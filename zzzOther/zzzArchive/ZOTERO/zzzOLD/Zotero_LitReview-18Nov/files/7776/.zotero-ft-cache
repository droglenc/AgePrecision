Abstract

Age and growth of the stingray Urogymnus polylepis were determined, for the first time, from bands in the vertebrae. Samples were obtained from naturally dying specimens in the two major rivers in central Thailand. Eighteen stingrays with disc length (DL) ranging between 30 and 187 cm were collected from the Chao Phraya River, while 53 fish ranging between 30 and 250 cm were collected from the Mae Klong River. The von Bertalanffy parameters were calculated for the Chao Phraya and the Mae Klong rivers as DL ¥ = 195.6 and 301.3 cm, K = 0.26 and 0.11 ·year -1 and DL 0 = 28.1 and 27.2 cm, respectively. The likelihood ratio test showed significant difference in growth between the two populations.
