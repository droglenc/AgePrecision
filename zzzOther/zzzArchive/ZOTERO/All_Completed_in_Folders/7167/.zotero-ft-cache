Abstract

We calculated between-reader precision of ages estimated with scales and whole otoliths (sagittae) of White Crappie Pomoxis annularis for 10 Minnesota populations, and determined effects of population and mean age on precision. For all samples combined, two experienced readers counted the same number of annuli on 91% of the scales and 92% of the whole otoliths. Mean coefficients of variation equaled 1.8% between scale readers and 3.0% between whole otolith readers. We detected no systematic age-bias between readers of each structure. Agreement between scale readers differed among populations, ranging from 67 to 100% among populations (median = 89%), but agreement also decreased with increasing scale age in six of these populations. Agreement between readers of whole otoliths was unaffected by increasing age of White Crappie, but agreement ranged from 39 to 100% among populations. When compared with other studies, latitude had no influence on precision of whole otolith ages because precision in the Minnesota populations differed little from precision reported for populations in Kentucky and Mississippi. Latitude could be affecting precision in scale age estimates because precision was usually better for the Minnesota populations than for populations in Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Mississippi; however, differences in viewing methods and reader competencies could also explain geographical differences.

Introduction

White Crappie Pomoxis annularis provide popular fisheries throughout their native range; however, primary methodologies for estimating age of this species differ geographically. Agencies in the southern United States primarily count annuli on whole views of sagittal otoliths (whole otoliths) for age estimation, whereas more northerly agencies usually estimate ages with annuli counts on scales ( Maceina et al. 2007 ). Biologists from northern agencies who favored scales for estimating age were reluctant to sacrifice fish for age estimation, but staff of many of these same agencies also trusted their scale age estimates despite their potential limitations ( Maceina et al. 2007 ).

Agencies in the southern United States curtailed scale use for estimating age of White Crappie because of poor precision, especially as age of White Crappie increased. For example, age precision between scale readers was rather poor; mean coefficients of variation (CV) of scale age equaled 59% for an Oklahoma population and percent agreement was 79% among four populations of White Crappie in Mississippi ( Boxrucker 1986 ; Hammers and Miranda 1991 ). Between-reader precision of scale age estimates also declined with increasing age of White Crappie in Mississippi reservoirs and Kentucky hatchery ponds ( Hammers and Miranda 1991 ; Ross et al. 2005 ). Conversely, precision in age estimates made with whole otoliths exceeded 90% and was not affected by increasing age in these same populations.

Precision and bias in scale or otolith age estimates of White Crappie from the northernmost regions of their natural range is not known and could be better than precision estimated from populations farther south. For example, between-reader agreement of scale age estimates from Black Crappie P. nigromaculatus in two South Dakota lakes equaled or exceeded 97%, and equaled between-reader agreement of whole otolith ages ( Kruse et al. 1993 ). Additionally, Hoxmeier et al. (2001) found better scale age precision of Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus from northern Illinois than from southern Illinois. Both Kruse et al. (1993) and Hoxmeier et al. (2001) speculated that extended periods of no growth during winter resulted in clearer annuli formed on scales from northern fishes. Conversely, Isermann et al. (2010) argued that latitude did not affect precision of scale age estimates after finding 33–36% agreement in scale age estimates of Black Crappie from two Minnesota lakes. However, the abilities of scale readers in the Isermann et al. (2010) study appear below average compared with other readers within their agency (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources; MNDNR) because McInerny and Cross (2008) found that mean agreement rates of scale ages between MNDNR biologists agency-wide and a trained, experienced scale reader ranged from 60% for age 5 to 93% for age 1 Black Crappie. Additionally, most (76%) agencies routinely assess reader precision ( Maceina et al. 2007 ), but the MNDNR does not nor do they provide formal training in age estimation ( McInerny et al. in press ). Lastly, none of these above-cited studies accounted for potential but unknown population-linked factors that could affect interpretation of annuli on age structures, which could also explain differences in scale age agreement between the South Dakota and Minnesota populations of Black Crappie. Fish for age estimation were either collected from one or two water bodies, or the authors' analysis did not account for differences in precision among populations from similar latitudes. Thus, population factors could explain differences in precision among studies rather than latitude.

Objectives of this study were to first determine between-reader precision of age estimates and age-bias between readers of scales and whole otoliths from White Crappie collected from several Minnesota lakes, and then test for the effects of age and population on precision. The hypothesis that latitude affects between-reader precision for scales and whole otoliths from White Crappie was then supported or refuted by comparing results in this study with the same metrics reported from studies south of Minnesota. Minnesota offers an ideal setting to test for effects of latitude because the northernmost boundary of the natural range of White Crappie includes North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Minnesota ( Fuller et al. 1999 ).
Methods
Data collection

During their routine summer sampling in 2001–2003, MNDNR fisheries management staff collected White Crappie from a representative set of lakes across their native range in Minnesota. Capture gears were either trap nets, experimental gill nets, or a combination of both ( MNDNR 1993 ). Staff measured each White Crappie (total length in mm) before removing scales from the left side just posterior of the depressed pectoral fin and extracting both sagittal otoliths. Staff placed scales and otoliths from each crappie in individually labeled coin envelopes and air-dried them. We then arbitrarily picked a minimum sample size of 10 White Crappie/lake in order to test for population effects on precision.

Readers prepared scales and otoliths and made age estimates following commonly used methods. One reader made all impressions of scales on cellulose acetate with the aid of a heated hydraulic shop press, and then both readers used microfiche readers to magnify scale images in order to reveal annuli. Readers first placed whole otoliths in a clear glass dish filled with water or ethanol (one reader used water; the other used ethanol). They then placed this dish on a black surface underneath a stereo microscope, and illuminated it with reflected light before counting annuli. Readers estimated age on each structure by counting annuli revealed by unique cutting and spacing patterns on scales or opaque, narrow, whitish bands on otoliths ( Quist et al. 2012 ). Most samples were collected in the summer; therefore, the date of sample collection was available for readers so that they could interpret whether the outer edge of each structure was an annulus or not. However, timing of annulus appearance on the edge of each structure was not known, and readers also did not have any other information that could aid in their age estimates.

The most competent readers that could be recruited estimated scale age and whole otolith age in order to minimize effects on between-reader precision caused by differences in reader ability. Three individuals participated in this study. One reader (R1) was competent in estimating age from both structures, one reader (R2) was competent in estimating age from scales, and one reader (R3) was competent in estimating age from whole otoliths. Thus, two scale age estimates and two whole otolith age estimates were made for each White Crappie. Each reader in this study received in the past either formal or informal training from other competent readers of the appropriate structure, and they had ≥10 y of practical experience that included comparisons of age estimates made with other structures, comparisons with modes of length-frequency distributions, and comparisons of ages from the same structure estimated by other competent readers. Readers worked at different locales, so different microfiche readers and microscopes were also used in this study.
Data analyses

We used percent agreement, mean CV of age, and age-bias analyses to describe precision and bias between readers for each method of age estimation ( Chang 1982 ; Campana et al. 1995 ). We calculated percent agreement and mean CV for all samples combined and for each population, whereas we tested age-bias by including all samples combined. To estimate mean CV of age, we calculated CV of age for each crappie aged by both readers, then summed all CVs for the entire sample, then divided this sum by the total number of crappie in each sample ( Chang 1982 ). We estimated age-bias between readers by calculating the mean age plus 95% confidence limits estimated by one reader as a function of the age estimated by the other reader ( Campana et al. 1995 ). Age-bias occurred if age estimated by one reader was consistently higher or consistently lower than age estimated by the other reader, and 95% confidence limits did not overlap. Next, we used logistic general linear models to test the effects of independent variables mean age, population, and their interactions on between-reader agreement (either yes or no) for each structure from each crappie. We compared all models along with the null model, and used bias-corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AIC c ) to select the best fitting model. The best models had the lowest AIC c scores or were within 2 AIC c of the lowest scores ( Burnham and Anderson 2002 ). We further evaluated model fit by examining residuals. The dependent variable can only have two possibilities, so we calculated confidence intervals (±2 standard errors) of the residuals per independent variable(s), and also generated a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing line ( Charpentier 2013 ). We determined model fit to be acceptable if confidence intervals of residuals consistently included zero across the range of the independent variable. We used version 3.4.3 of Program R for modeling and calculating confidence intervals of residuals ( R Core Team 2017 ). When reporting percent agreement, we used 80% as a benchmark because it represented the minimum acceptable agreement for many age structure evaluations ( Maceina et al. 2007 ).

Lastly, to determine if each structure provides the same age of each individual White Crappie, we calculated between-structure agreement and precision for the entire sample and by population. Age agreement (%) by population or the entire sample equaled the total number of individual crappies with CVs = 0 among the four estimates (two scale age and two whole otolith age estimates) divided by the appropriate total number (by population or the entire sample) of crappie aged (times 100). Mean CV equaled the sum of all CV per crappie divided by the total number of crappie aged ( Chang 1982 ). We then calculated mean scale ages and mean whole otolith ages for each crappie, and calculated Pearson correlations between these means.
Results

Ten or more White Crappie were collected from 10 lakes in 10 counties in southern Minnesota. Sample sizes ranged from 10 to 34/lake ( Table 1 ). Surface areas of these lakes ranged from 36 to 4,980 ha (median = 88 ha), maximum depths ranged from 2.6 to 18.3 m (median = 9.6 m), and latitudes ranged from 43.7 to 45.8° north (∼240 km separates the northernmost and southernmost population; Table 1 ). One-time samples were collected at each lake but at different months of the year ( Table 1 ). Total lengths of the 201 White Crappies ranged from 115 to 299 mm (mean = 189), and median total length per population ranged from 161 to 277 mm (Data S1, Supplemental Material ). Overall scale age estimates ranged from 1 to 9 while whole otolith ages ranged from 1 to 8 (both readers combined), but only two percent of estimates made with each structure exceeded age 5 (Data S1, Supplemental Material ). Median scale age and whole otolith age estimates ranged from 1 to 5 among the 10 populations. Scale age estimates were not made for two individuals because all scales were regenerated, but at least one otolith from all 201 crappies was readable.

Between-reader precision of age estimates was high for both methods of age estimation, and no significant age-bias was found. For all samples combined, percent agreement was 91% between scale readers and 92% between whole otolith readers. Similarly, mean CV of the entire sample was 1.8% between scale readers and 3.0% between whole otolith readers. Among disagreements, 94% of scale age and 94% of the whole otolith age estimates differed by one year, and differences never exceeded two years for either method. No clear systematic age-bias occurred between readers of either structure because age estimates of one reader either equaled mean age of the other or were within the 95% confidence limits of age estimates made by the other reader ( Table 2 ).

Precision of age estimates between scale readers differed among populations and declined with increasing scale age for most populations of White Crappie. Agreement ranged from 67 to 100% among populations (median = 89%), equaled or exceeded 80% in nine populations, and exceeded 90% in five populations ( Figure 1 ). Similarly, mean CV ranged from 0 to 6.3% (median = 1.9%) among populations ( Figure 1 ). Logistic general linear modeling suggested that precision was most affected by the interaction of mean scale age and population compared with mean age or population by themselves ( Table 3 ). Probability plots from the age + population model showed that agreement for four populations was either unaffected or weakly affected by increasing mean scale age (probabilities of reader agreement >80% across all scale ages); however, for three populations, probabilities that readers agree dropped below 80% by scale age 3 ( Figure 2 ). Additionally, probabilities of reader agreement dropped below 80% by scale age 4 in two other populations and by age 5 in one population ( Figure 2 ). Model fit appeared sufficient because confidence intervals of residuals along the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing line consistently included zero (plot not shown).

Solid gray lines denote probabilities of age agreement as a function of mean scale age by each population.

Between-reader precision of whole otolith age estimates also differed among populations but appeared unaffected by whole otolith age of White Crappie. Agreement ranged from 39 to 100% (median = 98%) among populations, equaled or exceeded 80% in nine populations, and exceeded 90% in eight populations ( Figure 1 ). Mean CV among populations ranged from 0 to 28% (median = 0.2%) and was <4% in nine populations ( Figure 1 ). Logistic general linear modeling suggested that agreement was affected by population and not by mean whole otolith age. The two better models (lowest AIC c scores) included population as an explanatory variable, and the effects of mean age by itself appeared weaker than the null model ( Table 3 ). Evaluation of residuals of the better two models also suggested good data fits. Lastly, the population effect was caused by one reader consistently counting one fewer annuli than the other on Carrie Lake otoliths, which were collected in June.

Both scale readers and both whole otolith readers estimated the same age for 81% of the 199 White Crappie, mean CV equaled 3.8%, and mean scale age and mean whole otolith age was highly correlated ( r = 0.97; n = 199; P < 0.0001). Among populations, agreement among all four age estimates ranged from 39 to 97% (median = 81%), and mean CV ranged from 0.3 to 17.1% (median = 2.6%).
Discussion

Precision of age estimates was high for both methods, suggesting that with proper training and experience, reproducible age estimates could be obtained using scales or otoliths of White Crappie in northern latitudes. Because most White Crappie in this study were relatively young (≤ age 5) and showed adequate growth (>170 mm by whole otolith age 3), the combination of few annuli coupled with adequate spacing of annuli on otoliths and scales could account for high precision for each method of age estimation. The relatively high precision found with each method also suggested negligible effects from using different microscopes or microfiche readers.

Overall, results in this study suggest that whole otoliths be used for estimating age of White Crappie in water bodies similar to this study because, unlike for scales, precision was unaffected by increasing age of White Crappie, and precision appeared unaffected by populations. The population effect detected in this study could be corrected by collecting White Crappie in spring or autumn, which allows for more certainty in interpretation of the otolith edge as an annulus. Timing of annulus appearance in White Crappie otoliths probably occurs during summer in Minnesota and probably differs among populations, similar to that found for Yellow Perch Perca flavescens in South Dakota, where annuli on whole otoliths of Yellow Perch appeared as early as June or as late as August ( Blackwell and Kaufman 2012 ).

Differences in between-reader precision of whole otolith ages appears unaffected by latitude, but instead appears affected by different experience levels and viewing methodology. Agreement between whole otolith readers for eight Minnesota populations and the Mississippi populations exceeded 90%, and median mean CV in this study (0.2%) differed little from mean CV (0.13%) between experienced readers in the Kentucky study ( Hammers and Miranda 1991 ; Ross et al. 2005 ). Except for the Carrie Lake outlier in this study, precision in all these studies exceeded precision for the Oklahoma population (mean CV = 8.1%). All readers in the Oklahoma study had no prior experience estimating age with whole otoliths before their study, and Ross et al. (2005) reported that ages estimated by readers with >10 y of experience agreed better (99–100%) with known-age White Crappie than ages estimated by readers with <1 y of experience (96–98%). Furthermore, whole otoliths in this study, the Mississippi study, and the Kentucky study were placed in dishes with black backgrounds and illuminated with reflected light before viewing with a microscope, but the Oklahoma biologists transmitted light through otoliths while viewing with a microscope. Resolution of annuli could differ between these two methods of viewing.

Variable interpretations of the scale edge as an annulus or not could have affected scale age precision for at least one population in this study, but the age+population effect on scale age agreement cannot be fully explained. New annuli appeared on scales of White Crappie in two Wright County, Minnesota, lakes sometime between mid-May and mid-June ( Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, unpublished data ). Assuming similar timing of annulus appearance for other Minnesota populations, uncertainty in interpretation of the scale edge by both readers was most likely for the Richardson population, which had the poorest precision, because this population was sampled in late May and some crappies were relatively old (scale age ≥5; Data S1, Supplemental Material ). However, precision was not affected by age composition among populations because mean and ranges of scale ages among the three populations (Double, Carrie, and St. Olaf) with 100% agreement (mean = 2.5, range = 1–5) differed little from means and ranges among the three populations (Richardson, Pepin, and Buffalo) with the poorest precision (mean = 2.5, range = 1–6; Data S1, Supplemental Material ). Thus, scale age precision appears to be affected by other unknown factors. Regardless, results from this study suggest that experienced scale readers should expect declining precision with increasing age in many White Crappie populations similar to those examined in this study.

Latitude could explain the better scale age precision observed for the Minnesota populations of White Crappie, but latitudinal differences in precision could also have been caused by different methods of viewing scales or variable reader competencies. Between-reader agreement in 9 of 10 Minnesota populations exceeded the 79% agreement reported for the Mississippi populations, mean CV in 7 of 10 Minnesota populations was below mean CV of 3.0% estimated by experienced readers for the Kentucky population, and mean CV of all the Minnesota populations was well below the mean CV of 59% reported for the Oklahoma population ( Boxrucker 1986 ; Hammers and Miranda 1991 ; Ross et al. 2005 ). Furthermore, autumn sampling of White Crappie, such as was done for all the southern populations, could have improved precision in at least one of the Minnesota populations because readers would have been reasonably certain that the scale edge was not an annulus. Conversely, the glass-pressing method used for viewing scales could have contributed to the lower precision reported for the Mississippi populations. Ross et al. (2005) found that the two same readers had lower precision (mean CV = 5.7%) when scale ages of White Crappie were estimated via glass-pressing than when they estimated age via viewing scale impressions on acetate (mean CV = 3.0%), which was done in this study. An argument can be made that scale readers in the Oklahoma study, all rated as experienced, lacked proper training in estimating age with scales, which resulted in their abnormally low precision compared with all other precision estimates for White Crappie. Based on the random sample of 20 White Crappie from the Oklahoma population, scale age estimated by one reader never agreed with scale age estimated by two other readers, and agreement between the two latter readers was only 30% ( Boxrucker 1986 ). Boxrucker (1986) also reported that 97% of the scale ages estimated by Missouri biologists agreed with whole otolith age for a Missouri population of White Crappie only 24 min north in latitude from the Oklahoma population ( Boxrucker 1986 ). This Missouri example coupled with between-reader agreements exceeding 66% and mean CVs below 7% among all other White Crappie populations suggests that annuli were usually distinguishable on White Crappie scales regardless of location. Lastly, experience in scale reading does not necessarily equate to competence in age estimation because Ross et al. (2005) reported that scale ages determined by an inexperienced reader (<1 y of professional experience reader) agreed better (94% compared with 81–86%) with known-age White Crappie (ages 1–5) than scale ages estimated by two experienced readers (>10 y of professional experience). Thus, effects of latitude on scale age precision cannot be fully resolved until scales of White Crappie from various geographic locations are collected in spring or autumn, and ages are estimated by properly trained, competent readers viewing scales with the same method.
