  abstract = {Largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides (Lacep\`ede), smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu Lacep\`ede, and yellow perch, Perca flavescens (Mitchill), were collected from the Hudson River, New York, USA, to compare the precision of age estimates derived from scales and otoliths. Similar procedures were used to compare otolith and spine ages from brown bullhead, Ameiurus nebulosus (Lesueur). Overall percent agreement between readers ranged from 91\% to 98\% for otoliths compared with 38\% to 67\% for scales and spines. Disagreement rates associated with scales and spines increased as fish grew older. Average percent error between readers was about an order of magnitude higher for scales and spines than for otoliths. Ages estimated from scales and spines progressively decreased as age increased based on otolith examination. The use of scales and spines to age largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, yellow perch and brown bullheads from the northeastern US was less precise and will likely lead to underestimation of age of larger and older fish.},

  abstract = {Otoliths of long rough dab (Hippoglossoides platessoides) were analysed using both stereomicroscope and digitised pictures. Approximately 400 fish were aged twice by each technique. The use of digitised pictures gave consistently higher precision of age-determinations. This was shown both graphically and by use of the coefficient of variation. Age determined from digitised pictures was generally higher than that determined by using a stereomicroscope. This was particularly true for older specimens. For some individuals a change in the zoning pattern in the otoliths was observed. The occurrence of these changes was not closely correlated with the visually determined maturation index. For fish of similar size otolith radius was correlated with age. The growth rate also influenced otolith morphology. This additional information is incorporated in the outline of an objective age-determination suggested by this study.},

  abstract = {Currently, there is a conflict between the need to conserve protected fish species and the need to use lethal methods to collect essential biological data, such as age, to assess their population status and recovery trends. We evaluated the precision and accuracy of a non-lethal ageing method for goliath grouper Epinephelus itajara, listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Paired finray and otolith samples (n = 21) were collected opportunistically from fish that had died primarily from red tide or hypothermal events in Florida coastal waters. Finray ageing proved relatively precise (coefficient of variation [CV] = 4.24\%), although less so than otolith ageing (CV = 1.45\%). Finray ages agreed with otolith ages the majority of the time (CV = 3.15\% and concordance correlation coefficient = 0.991) for E. itajara from 0 to 18 yr of age. Based on a test of symmetry, finray ageing was also relatively unbiased for fish up to 18 yr of age. Further evaluation of any limitations of the method will depend on obtaining more samples, especially from larger, presumably older, fish. Clearly, the non-lethal finray ageing method can be used as an alternative to using otoliths for goliath grouper at least up to 18 yr of age. Finray ageing could significantly reduce the need to sacrifice protected E. itajara to assess their population recovery.},

  abstract = {Although accurate age data are essential when estimating somatic growth and mortality rates required to effectively manage exploited walleye (Sander vitreus) populations, aging structures have not been validated for age ranges present in most walleye populations. Otoliths and dorsal spines were collected from 302 walleye considered known age in the Winnebago System, Wisconsin, USA: 142 that were assigned ages via progression of discrete length modes following an individual strong year class (ages 0\textendash{}3), and 160 (ages 4\textendash{}10, 12\textendash{}13, 16, 18) that were initially tagged at lengths small enough to accurately assign age $\pm$1 year ($<$380mm) and later recaptured and assigned an age (assigned age at tagging plus number of years at liberty). Paired aging structures were also collected from over 2000 additional walleye sampled during spawning assessments, tournament monitoring, and other surveys to better understand the relationship between spine and otolith age estimates and to compare catch curve residuals from structure and sex-specific catch curves to standard walleye recruitment indices. We found otoliths were accurate for walleye ages 0\textendash{}10, while dorsal spines yielded relatively accurate age estimates for walleye ages 1\textendash{}5, but underestimated age of walleye age-6 and older. Age distributions within catch curves constructed from otolith age estimates correlated well with measured year class strength, while age distributions from dorsal spine age estimates correlated poorly. Our results from fish considered known age validate the accuracy of otolith age estimates for walleye up to age-10, with corroborating evidence from catch curves and accurate recruitment indices strongly suggesting that otoliths are valid for all ages of Winnebago System walleye. We recommend the use of otoliths to accurately estimate walleye age, growth, and mortality, and to provide accurate age data for other population analyses.},

Age estimates showed high numbers of fish of ages 5, 6, and 11 in 2014, corresponding to the 2009, 2008, and 2003 year-classes, respectively. Strong 2003 and 2009 year-classes, along with the 2005 year-class, were also evident based on distinct modes of age-1 fish ($<$110 mm) in the length frequency distributions from 2004, 2010, and 2006, respectively. Modes from these year-classes were present as progressively larger fish in subsequent years. Few to no age-1 fish ($<$110 mm) were present in all other years. Ages estimated from otoliths were generally within 1 year of the ages corresponding to strong year-classes, at least for age-5 and older fish, suggesting that Kiyi age may be reliably estimated to within 1 year by careful examination of thin-sectioned otoliths.},

  abstract = {Accurate quantitative descriptions of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) growth are important for understanding life history and developing reliable stock assessments. In the absence of age validation, important steps are to review the precision of age estimation methods and evaluate whether age estimates yield growth rates consistent with known fish growth based on tag recoveries. We assessed the precision of age estimates using pelvic fin rays and scales for migratory bull trout (297-605 mm total length) from the North Fork Clearwater River, and then compared growth estimates derived from both structures with growth based on tag recoveries. Fin rays produced a lower coefficient of variation (CV = 5.84) than scales (CV = 12.56). Ages estimated from scales were higher for fish aged $<$ 5 with fin rays and lower for fish aged $\geq$ 5. Comparisons of growth estimates derived from 70 tagged bull trout at large from 0.35 to 3.02 years with age-length equations based on fin ray and scale annuli indicated that ages estimated from fin rays (N = 189, predicted length of an age 3 fish = 310mm) were closely related to the apparent ages estimated from the mark-recapture model (apparent age of a 310mm fish = 2.9) whereas scales (N = 65, predicted length of an age 3 fish = 408mm) were not. This is the first study to assess the precision of structures for modeling growth of larger migratory bull trout.

Mean and systematic differences in age estimates were compared among structures using consensus ages from two readers; precision of age structures was quantified through the use of age\textendash{}bias plots, coefficient of variation, and percent agreement; reader confidence was indexed as a measure of overall reader uncertainty for each individual fish by structure. Mean age estimates based on otoliths were systematically higher (7.8 years) than based on scales (6.0 years) or fin rays (5.6 years). Ages determined using otoliths generated a wider range of ages and greater number of age classes (1\textendash{}23 years, 20 age classes) when compared with scales (1\textendash{}16 years, 15 age classes) and fin rays (1\textendash{}14 years, 13 age classes). Otoliths were the most precise of the structures (CV = 4.7, compared with 7.4 for scales and 12.1 for fin rays). Percent agreement between readers indicated high precision and reproducibility of age estimates using otoliths. Percent reader uncertainty was lowest when using otoliths (7.6\%) in comparison with fin rays (21.2\%) or scales (26.8\%). This study is the first evaluation of precision and bias of age structures for Lake Champlain's unexploited lake whitefish population and suggests that otoliths are the most appropriate structure for age estimation. However, the differences in age estimates from the three structures in this study emphasize the importance of validating aging structures to provide accurate age estimates for Lake Champlain.},

  abstract = {Recreational angling for gars (family Lepisosteidae) has become more popular in recent years; however, the fundamental understanding of their population dynamics needed for effective management and conservation is lacking. Age data are essential for describing population dynamic rate functions, but few studies have addressed the selection of ideal calcified structures for estimating age in gars. We collected Spotted Gars Lepisosteus oculatus, Shortnose Gars L. platostomus, and Longnose Gars L. osseus from 12 Illinois water bodies to assess the relative bias and precision of age estimates derived from branchiostegal rays, pectoral fin rays, cleithra, and sagittal otoliths. Age assignments differed among these calcified structures for all three species. Branchiostegal rays underestimated the age of young fish and overestimated the age of old fish relative to all other structures. Pectoral fin rays consistently underestimated age relative to other structures and produced the lowest mean and maximum age estimates. Although there was low relative bias between readers for all structures, age assignments showed greater variability between readers for old age-classes when age estimates were derived from cleithra and otoliths. Between-reader precision was highest using pectoral fin rays, whereas cleithra and otoliths generated lower coefficients of variation and percent agreement values. These findings reveal a need to improve or modify structure processing methods to increase readability when cleithra and otoliths are used for age estimation. Given these results, future validation studies should target branchiostegal rays and pectoral fin rays to determine the most accurate calcified structure for aging gars.},

In the first test, the readers determined the age of each individual from one calcified structure (scale, otolith, or opercular bone) at a time. The samples from three populations, 50 specimens in each, were mixed so that the readers did not know which population each calcified structure was from. A sample of known-age whitefish was used in the second age determination test, where information such as time of catch, length, weight, and sex was available to the readers. In each of the 50 envelopes the reader got scale impressions and two otoliths, one of which had been burned and ground. In the first test, the precision of the readers was low both between readers and between different structures. In the samples of slow-growing populations, the determinations made from the otoliths showed older ages than the determinations from the scales. In the second age determination test the results were better; 73-90\% (average 82\%) of the determinations were correct. The use of two calcified structures and the knowledge of the material were considered to improve the accuracy. Age determination bias may occur that affects the age distribution: even though 80\% of the fish were aged correctly, an exceptionally strong or weak year class could remain unidentified. The estimation of growth rate seemed less sensitive to incorrect age determination than age distribution.},

  abstract = {The White Perch Morone americana is an invasive species in many Midwestern states and is widely distributed in reservoir systems, yet little is known about the species' age structure and population dynamics. White Perch were first observed in Sooner Reservoir, a thermally altered cooling reservoir in Oklahoma, by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation in 2006. It is unknown how thermally altered systems like Sooner Reservoir may affect the precision of White Perch age estimates. Previous studies have found that age structures from Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and Bluegills Lepomis macrochirus from thermally altered reservoirs had false annuli, which increased error when estimating ages. Our objective was to quantify the precision of White Perch age estimates using four sagittal otolith preparation techniques (whole, broken, browned, and stained). Because Sooner Reservoir is thermally altered, we also wanted to identify the best month to collect a White Perch age sample based on aging precision. Ages of 569 White Perch (20\textendash{}308 mm TL) were estimated using the four techniques. Age estimates from broken, stained, and browned otoliths ranged from 0 to 8 years; whole-view otolith age estimates ranged from 0 to 7 years. The lowest mean coefficient of variation (CV) was obtained using broken otoliths, whereas the highest CV was observed using browned otoliths. July was the most precise month (lowest mean CV) for estimating age of White Perch, whereas April was the least precise month (highest mean CV). These results underscore the importance of knowing the best method to prepare otoliths for achieving the most precise age estimates and the best time of year to obtain those samples, as these factors may affect other estimates of population dynamics.},

Scales and pelvic fin rays collected from recaptured bull trout 96\textendash{}265 mm TL were used to validate annulus formation and assess the accuracy and precision of back calculation. Ageing precision and agreement of assigned ages were compared among scales, fin rays and otoliths from bull trout 52\textendash{}711 mm TL. Annulus formation was validated for 88\% (14 of 16 fish) of recaptured bull trout using pelvic fin rays and 68\% using scales (15 of 22 fish). Annulus formation in fin rays occurred between late April to early June, and the hyaline (non-growth) band began forming in late August. Back-calculated length was not significantly different from measured length at initial capture either for fin rays or scales (P \textdaggerdbl{} 0.19), and absolute percent error was 7.2 $\pm$ 1.2 (mean $\pm$ SE; n = 14) for fin rays and 8.7 $\pm$ 1.9 (n = 15) for scales. Consistency of back-calculated lengths at age between tag and recapture samples for individual fish was similar for fin rays (mean absolute difference = 8.2\% $\pm$ 0.9; n = 33) and scales (9.4\% $\pm$ 1.4; n = 40). However, fin rays (87\% precision) and otoliths (90\%) provided notably higher ageing precision than scales (68\%) and closer agreement of assigned ages, particularly for fish older than age 4. Pelvic fin rays appear to offer more accurate and precise age and growth determinations than scales and a non-lethal alternative to otoliths, but further work is needed to validate the accuracy and precision of ageing large, migratory bull trout.},

The goal of this study was to determine whether a more precise nonlethal structure could be used to age largemouth bass. We examined scales, pectoral fin rays, and dorsal fin spines from largemouth bass collected from six glacial lakes in northern Indiana. Collectively, 861 structures were aged by three analysts and post-concert reads concluded with 85\%, 94\%, and 99\% agreement for scales, pectoral fin rays, and dorsal fin spines, respectively. Pre-concert exact ($\pm$ 0 years) percent agreement among age analysts was highest for dorsal fin spines (27\%) followed by pectoral fin rays (23\%) and scales (2\%). Mean coefficient of variation was lowest among dorsal fin spines (16\%) followed by pectoral fin rays (22\%) and scales (37\%). Scales exhibited the most variability and bias, while dorsal fin spines were the least variable and most unbiased structure. We encourage researchers to use scales for younger fish and dorsal fin spines for larger fish when both: (1) nonlethal methods and (2) a higher standard of precision are sought to evaluate specific management objectives.},

Typically, fisheries managers are hesitant to use lethal aging techniques (e.g., otoliths) to age rare species, trophy-size fish, or when sampling in small impoundments where populations are small. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the precision and accuracy of 2 non-lethal aging structures (i.e., anal fin spines, dorsal fin spines) in comparison to that of sagittal otoliths from known-age Micropterus salmoides (Largemouth Bass; n = 87) collected from the Ocmulgee Public Fishing Area, GA. Sagittal otoliths exhibited the highest concordance with true ages of all structures evaluated (coefficient of variation = 1.2; percent agreement = 91.9). Similarly, the low coefficient of variation (0.0) and high between-reader agreement (100\%) indicate that age estimates obtained from sagittal otoliths were the most precise. Relatively high agreement between readers for anal fin spines (84\%) and dorsal fin spines (81\%) suggested the structures were relatively precise. However, age estimates from anal fin spines and dorsal fin spines exhibited low concordance with true ages. Although use of sagittal otoliths is a lethal technique, this method will likely remain the standard for aging Largemouth Bass and other similar black bass species.},

In our study, four readers estimated the ages of the fish using each of the four structures. Opercles had the lowest coefficient of variation (CV) for both species (Largemouth Bass = 6.31, Smallmouth Bass = 5.23), but underestimated the ages of Largemouth Bass older than nine and Smallmouth Bass older than six, relative to otoliths.

We recommend that fin rays be used to estimate age of native catostomids and roundtail chub in the UCRB because fin rays provide accurate estimates of otolith age and can be obtained without sacrificing fish. We further recommend that otoliths be used to estimate age of creek chub in the UCRB because accuracy of fin rays was poor and because sacrificing this nonnative species may benefit native fishes of the UCRB.},

  volume = {5},
  abstract = {Saugeye are hatchery produced hybrids (female walleye [Sander vitreus] and male sauger [S. canadensis]) that have been introduced to aquatic systems throughout the United States. The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation (ODWC) stocks reservoirs throughout Oklahoma with saugeye to control overcrowded, stunted white crappie (Pomoxis annularis) populations and to provide recreational fishing opportunities. Because sacrificing fish regularly to remove otoliths for age estimation is often unpopular with anglers, a non-lethal means of obtaining age estimates for saugeye to describe population dynamics is desirable. Therefore, we compared age estimate precision between readers and structures (otoliths and dorsal spines), and compared age-based population parameters (growth, mortality, recruitment) derived from these age estimates. Structures were removed from 47 saugeye collected from Thunderbird Reservoir, Oklahoma via electrofishing. Separate age-length keys were developed using consensus ages estimated from each structure, and ages were applied to an additional 253 unaged saugeye (300 fish total) for comparison of age-based population parameters for each structure. Precision was highest between readers for broken otoliths (100\% agreement; CV\,=\,0\%) and whole otoliths (98\% agreement; CV\,=\,3.2\%), whereas precision was poor for dorsal spine ages (55\% agreement; CV\,=\,22.3\%). When comparing final consensus ages, broken otoliths and whole otoliths were in 100\% agreement; however, otolith and spine agreement was 14\%. Age bias plots indicate that final consensus spine ages always were higher than the final consensus ages from otoliths. Because age assignments from the two structures were dissimilar, corresponding mortality rates, growth models, and recruitment patterns were vastly different. We concluded that dorsal spines are not an appropriate aging structure for saugeye in Oklahoma, as age estimates lacked precision and produced erroneous population parameters. Fisheries managers should continue to sacrifice saugeye to obtain otoliths for aging for the most reliable data.},

Using otoliths of the two major commercial species, golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and deep-sea redfish (S. mentella), a series of exchange schemes was carried out to assess bias and precision of age readings between four readers and between two preparation methods. Considerable bias between readers and moderate precision were observed for the S. marinus readings, especially for ages O20 years, with coefficients of variation (CV) of 7.7e12.0\% and average percent error (APE) of 5.4e8.5\%. Agreement between readers increased from 17e28\% to 45e61\% when allowing deviations of G1 year, and to 80e92\% with G3 years tolerance. The age of S. marinus determined from broken and burnt otoliths was estimated to be slightly lower than when the age of the same individuals was determined from thin-sectioned otoliths. The bias and precision estimates obtained from the S. mentella material were generally poorer than for S. marinus (CV 8.2e19.1\%, APE 5.8e13.5\%), but similar to reported values for other long-lived fish species. Better than 50\% agreement was only achieved with G3 years tolerance. Growth rates differed significantly between species, confirming slower growth for S. mentella. For S. marinus, only one reader comparison revealed significantly different growth functions, whereas almost all S. mentella reader pairs showed significant differences in growth curves. Section and break-and-burn readings of S. marinus did not differ significantly. Average ages of around 9e10 years were determined for juvenile S. mentella 24e30 cm long, which were likely to have migrated from East Greenland into the Irminger Sea, based on earlier observations. As some of the error in the age determinations presented could be attributed to interpretation differences between readers, further intercalibration of redfish ageing is urgently needed in order to provide consistent input data for stock assessment. \'O 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Scale derived age estimates were on average younger than otolith derived estimates. The maximum age of the fish collected from Ham's Fork and Yellow Creek was three years.

In this investigation, we examined precision of age estimates derived from scales, pectoral fin rays, and sagittal otoliths from 167 mountain whitefish. Otoliths and pectoral fin rays were mounted in epoxy and cross-sectioned before examination. Scales were pressed onto acetate slides and resulting impressions were examined. Between-reader precision (i.e., between 2 readers), between-reader variability, and reader confidence ratings were compared among hard structures. Coefficient of variation (CV) in age estimates was lowest and percentage of exact agreement (PA-0) was highest for scales (CV = 5.9; PA-0 = 70\%) compared to pectoral fin rays (CV = 11.0; PA-0 = 58\%) and otoliths (CV = 12.3; PA-0 = 55\%). Median confidence ratings were significantly different (P $\leq$ 0.05) among all structures, with scales having the highest median confidence. Reader confidence decreased with fish age for scales and pectoral fin rays, but reader confidence increased with fish age for otoliths. In general, age estimates were more precise and reader confidence was higher for scales compared to pectoral fin rays and otoliths. This research will help fisheries biologists in selecting the most appropriate hard structure to use for future age and growth studies on mountain whitefish. In turn, selection of the most precise hard structure will lead to better estimates of dynamic rate functions.},

We evaluated the use of dorsal spines and scales as nonlethal alternatives to otoliths for estimating the ages of black crappies P. nigromaculatus using 111 fish collected from two Minnesota lakes. Among-reader precision was similar for ages estimated from scales and dorsal spines (coefficients of variation [CVs] \textonequarter{} 10\textendash{}14\%), but the precision associated with both structures was substantially lower than that observed for otoliths (CVs \textonequarter{} 0.12\textendash{}1.3\%). Complete reader agreement (i.e., all three readers agreed on age) for dorsal spines (44\textendash{}51\%) and scales (33\textendash{}36\%) was substantially lower than that observed for otoliths (87\textendash{}98\%). Partial agreement (i.e., at least two of three readers agreed on age) was 100\% for both otoliths and dorsal spines and between 79\% and 89\% for scales. Scale ages assigned by individual readers agreed with consensus otolith ages less than 70\% of the time; agreement of individual spine ages with consensus otolith ages was 33\% or less. Mean scale ages were usually similar to consensus otolith ages for crappies between the ages of 2 and 6 years, while mean spine ages were consistently lower than consensus otolith ages. Thin-sectioning dorsal spines did not significantly change the number of annuli detected by individual readers. Our results suggest that dorsal spines are not a useful alternative to scales for estimating black crappie age in a nonlethal manner. A conspicuous lumen located in the center of each dorsal spine partially or fully obscures at least one annulus. When otolith removal is not desirable, use of scales and multiple readers may provide mean age estimates that are similar to consensus otolith ages, but we suggest that otolith analysis remains the most reliable method for estimating black crappie age, regardless of latitude.},

To examine the accuracy and precision of age estimates, 16 pectoral fin ray samples from age-6 pallid sturgeon were obtained from Gavins Point National Fish Hatchery, South Dakota. The fin rays were sectioned, mounted, and independently examined twice by each of two readers. Only 28.1\% of the age estimates accurately reflected the known age of the fish. Multiple readings of the same sample by the same reader (within-reader precision) only agreed 25\% of the time, differences being as great as 5 years between the two estimates. Between-reader agreement was 46.9\%, the two readers' estimates of the same fish differing by as much as 2 years. Because of low accuracy and precision, estimated ages from pallid sturgeon pectoral fin rays should be viewed with caution.},

Removal and processing times were calculated by 10 fish groups. Dorsal spines required the least amount of time for removal, followed by scales and otoliths. Whole-view otoliths required no further manipulation prior to estimating age, while the sectioning of dorsal spines and scale pressing required 12.5 and 16.6 min of additional processing time, respectively. Dorsal spines and scales also required significantly more time to read than otoliths. In terms of total processing time, whole-view otoliths proved the most time-efficient approach for estimating the age of walleyes. Scales were slightly more time-efficient than dorsal-spine sections, and sectioning otoliths would add additional processing time. Sectioning may not have been necessary in this evaluation because ages estimated by an experienced viewer from the sectioned otoliths agreed with ages estimated from whole-view otoliths 98\% of the time (although reader inexperience could result in lower rates of agreement). The relative precision between readers was approximately five times greater with whole-view otoliths than with scales or spines. Reader agreement rates associated with whole-view otoliths were also significantly higher than rates for scales or spines. Based on our findings, otoliths provide the most time-efficient and precise approach for estimating the age of walleyes.},

We quantified precision and bias of ages estimated from cleithra, otoliths, anal fin rays, and scales of Northern Pike sampled in tributaries of Green Bay, Lake Michigan. For three independent readers, the precision (CV) of age estimates did not significantly differ among otoliths, cleithra, and anal fin rays but was significantly lower for scales than for the other structures. Similarly, partial agreement among readers was greater than 90\% for ages estimated from otoliths, cleithra, and anal fin rays, whereas partial agreement was 76\% for scale-based ages. We discuss the tradeoffs associated with precision and bias for each structure in the context of reader experience, fish age, and management goals. We recommend that when fish mortality is not a concern, otoliths or cleithra should be used to achieve high-precision aging of Northern Pike. For strictly nonlethal sampling scenarios, the anal fin rays of Northern Pike will yield more precise age estimates than scales.},

To our knowledge, no research has identified which calcified structure provides the most precise age estimates for mountain sucker, and little is known about mountain sucker population dynamics. To identify which structure provided the most precise age estimates, we compared age estimates from scales, sectioned pectoral fin rays, whole asteriscus otoliths, and polished asteriscus otoliths collected from 110 mountain sucker from 2 creeks in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Additionally, we quantified growth, age, and size at maturation for one population of mountain sucker in the Black Hills. Polished otoliths had the greatest precision of the 4 structures used, followed by sectioned pectoral fin rays. Mountain sucker reached an average size of 100 mm total length (TL) during their fourth growing season and reached an average maximum attainable size of 219 mm TL. Mountain sucker began to mature at age 3, with nearly all being mature by age 5. In the Black Hills, the shortest mature male was 95 mm TL and the shortest mature female was 101 mm TL. We recommend using polished otoliths to estimate the ages of mountain sucker. If a nonlethal structure is desired to estimate the ages of mountain sucker, we recommend using sectioned pectoral fin rays. Future research should be directed to fill the many knowledge gaps in the biology and ecology of mountain sucker (e.g., juvenile habitat use in the Black Hills). As these knowledge gaps are addressed, management actions could be taken to conserve this species in the parts of its range where it is declining.},

  abstract = {Dorsal spines may be a suitable structure for aging walleyes Sander vitreus when the otoliths are unavailable due to live release of the catch, but the specialized equipment and additional time necessary to remove and mount a readable cross section can discourage their use. I evaluated a simple method of obtaining age estimates from unsectioned dorsal spines. The basal end of each dorsal spine was sanded smooth and viewed under a dissecting microscope with side illumination. For Red Lake, Minnesota, walleyes, where consensus otolith ages by two experienced readers indicated that most fish were younger than age 7, reader agreement rates (95\%) and precision (mean coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.95\%) of dorsal spine estimates were relatively high. Age estimates by individual readers inspecting spines generally agreed with consensus otolith ages ($\geq$95\%). Reader agreement rates (70\%) and precision (mean CV = 2.71\%) were much lower for a sample of walleyes collected from Mille Lacs Lake, Minnesota, where 94\% of consensus otolith ages were greater than age 6. Furthermore, spine-based age estimates for Mille Lacs Lake walleyes exhibited relatively poor agreement with consensus otolith ages ($\leq$40\%); however, most of the discrepancies were noted for individuals of consensus otolith age 7 or more, and consistent underestimation of ages did not occur until age 13. Based on these findings, unsectioned dorsal spines offered a reasonably precise, nonlethal, and simple approach for replicating consensus otolith ages for walleyes younger than age 7. Although otoliths may still be necessary to estimate the ages of older individuals within a sample, use of unsectioned dorsal spines could allow biologists to sacrifice fewer walleyes while closely replicating otolith-based estimates of population age structure.},

We also validated a new method using pectoral spines in which a single cut is made through the dorsal and anterior processes (hereafter termed cut spines) and annuli are enhanced with side illumination. Age estimates from otoliths and cut spines were compared with age estimates from traditional articulating process sections of pectoral spines for channel catfish of known ages (1\textendash{}4). Age estimates by the three methods were correct for more than 90\% of fish after two experienced readers independently estimated ages and resolved disagreements by mutual examination. Otoliths were more accurate and less variable in estimating age. Otolith age estimates were always within 1 year and, after mutual examination of the structures in question, 97\% of the assigned ages agreed with known age. The accuracy of cut spines and articulating process sections after mutual examination was similar; however, the cut-spine method was simpler than preparing articulating process sections. Otolith annuli were more distinguishable than pectoral spine annuli and were validated for age-1\textendash{}4 channel catfish. Therefore, we recommend using otoliths to estimate the age of channel catfish.},

Accuracy was improved by identifying the period of annulus formation (May-June) from the position of an OTC mark relative to translucent zones in fin ray cross sections. However, age was underestimated from counts of translucent zones formed after injection with OTC, especially for slow-growing and large fish. We conclude that age estimateswere not precise or accurate and recommend development of alternative methods for aging white sturgeons to supplement the fin ray method. We urge that aging data based on the fin ray method be applied cautiously. Imprecision limits interpretation of age frequencies and relative year-class strengths. Inaccuracy results in overestimation of growth, mortality, and sustainable exploitation rates.},

  abstract = {Yellow perch Perca flavescens support economically important recreational and commercial fisheries in Lake Erie and are intensively managed. Age estimation represents an integral component in the management of Lake Erie yellow perch stocks, as age-structured population models are used to set safe harvest levels on an annual basis. We compared the precision associated with yellow perch (N \textonequarter{} 251) age estimates from scales, sagittal otoliths, and anal spine sections and evaluated the time required to process and estimate age from each structure. Three readers of varying experience estimated ages. The precision (mean coefficient of variation) of estimates among readers was 1\% for sagittal otoliths, 5\textendash{}6\% for anal spines, and 11\textendash{}13\% for scales. Agreement rates among readers were 94\textendash{}95\% for otoliths, 71\textendash{}76\% for anal spines, and 45\textendash{}50\% for scales. Systematic age estimation differences were evident among scale and anal spine readers; less-experienced readers tended to underestimate ages of yellow perch older than age 4 relative to estimates made by an experienced reader. Mean scale age tended to underestimate ages of age-6 and older fish relative to otolith ages estimated by an experienced reader. Total annual mortality estimates based on scale ages were 20\% higher than those based on otolith ages; mortality estimates based on anal spine ages were 4\% higher than those based on otolith ages. Otoliths required more removal and preparation time than scales and anal spines, but age estimation time was substantially lower for otoliths than for the other two structures. We suggest the use of otoliths or anal spines for age estimation in yellow perch (regardless of length) from Lake Erie and other systems where precise age estimates are necessary, because age estimation errors resulting from the use of scales could generate incorrect management decisions.},

However, little historic attention has been given to the reliability of age estimates gathered from several nations involved in this assessment. Using recognised graphical and statistical approaches, bias and precision was investigated for experienced age-readers of blue whiting. Significant linear bias was found to exist between age-readers, with ages differing, on average, by 1 year for important year classes. Indications are that spawning checks and split rings affect the interpretation of annuli for some age-readers. An experience gradient became evident during the analysis; more experienced age-readers had greater levels of precision. Within reader precision was found to be higher than between reader precision; however, within reader bias was also evident with two out of three age-readers systematically revising ages downwards when re-ageing otoliths. Results indicate that differences exist on a limited international level for the age determination of blue whiting. This issue now needs to be addressed by the scientific community.},

Annulus deposition occurred during March and April, and was complete by May. Patterns of growth in both length-atage and weight-at-age were not different either between the sexes or between subspecies. Sheepshead were smaller at any given age compared to fish from South Carolina, but were generally larger than sheepshead used in coast-wide estimates for Florida. Fish from Louisiana were of similar overall size compared to sheepshead from both the northwest coast of Florida and coast-wide Florida. The use of regionally-explicit models of growth may be appropriate for sheepshead because of growth differences among populations in the southeastern United States. These differences in growth may result from several factors, including differences in mortality rates, environmental conditions, or genetic variation.},

In order to gain insight into the life history of this species, the age, growth and maturity of 231 skates ranging in size from 277 to 630-mm total length (TL) were examined. Based on vertebral band counts, the oldest age estimates obtained were 8 years for males and 9 for females, which corresponded to 495-mm TL and 630-mm TL respectively. Age-bias plots and coefficient of variation suggested that our ageing method represents a non-biased and precise approach to age assessment. Marginal increment and edge analyses suggested that growth bands are formed annually with a distinct trend of increasing growth at the beginning of March. Back calculations suggested a birth size of 113\textendash{}118-mm TL. Observed and back-calculated length-at-age data were used to assess growth with four different models, including the von Bertalanffy (VBGM), von Bertalanffy with size at birth (VB with L0), Gompertz and Francis models. Male and female growth was significantly different. The VBGM and the Francis model produced similar results and provided the best fit. Curves fitted with observed and back-calculated data suggested slightly faster growth than curves fitted with only observed data. Maturity occurred at 444-mm TL and 4.95 years for males, whereas females matured at 537-mm TL and 5.8 years.},

  abstract = {We evaluated annulus formation and readers' ability to recognize known annuli from otoliths, pectoral fin rays, and scales of alligator gar Atractosteus spatula using known-age (0 and 1 years) and chemically marked fish. Chemical marks were generally associated with annuli, and confirmed annulus formation occurred around May. In all bony structures, annuli appeared as narrow translucent lines that immediately preceded wider opaque bands; however, annuli in pectoral fin rays and scales were more variable in appearance than otoliths. In otoliths, the number of observed annuli corresponded with the number of years fish were at large for 96\% of the fish. In contrast, periodicity of annuli in pectoral fin rays and scales only corresponded with the number of years fish were at large in 19\% and 12\% of the fish, respectively. Precision of age estimates was initially poor for all structures; percent agreement between two independent readers was only 49\% for otoliths, 43\% for pectoral fin rays, and 37\% for scales. Agreement increased to 83\% for otoliths, 65\% for pectoral fin rays, and 60\% for scales following a second independent age assessment. Final average coefficients of variation between readers were 2, 5, and 11\% for otoliths, pectoral fin rays, and scales, respectively. Increased precision was the result of experience and an improved ability to identify annuli because of chemical reference marks. Although correct identification of annuli required substantial training, our study validates annulus formation in otoliths of alligator gar. In contrast, annulus formation was not validated for pectoral fin rays or scales from alligator gar older than age 6, but age estimates from pectoral fin rays of young alligator gar may have some utility.

  abstract = {The ages of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis are typically estimated using scales despite a lack of research documenting the effectiveness of this technique. The use of scales is often preferred because it is nonlethal and is believed to require less effort than alternative methods. To evaluate the relative effectiveness of different age estimation methodologies for brook trout, we measured the precision and processing times of scale, sagittal otolith, and pectoral fin ray age estimation techniques. Three independent readers, age bias plots, coefficients of variation (CV \textonequarter{} 100 3 SD/mean), and percent agreement (PA) were used to measure within-reader, among-structure bias and within-structure, among-reader precision. Bias was generally minimal; however, the age estimates derived from scales tended to be lower than those derived from otoliths within older (age . 2) cohorts. Otolith, fin ray, and scale age estimates were within 1 year of each other for 95\% of the comparisons. The measures of precision for scales (CV \textonequarter{} 6.59; PA \textonequarter{} 82.30) and otoliths (CV \textonequarter{} 7.45; PA \textonequarter{} 81.48) suggest higher agreement between these structures than with fin rays (CV \textonequarter{} 11.30; PA \textonequarter{} 65.84). The mean per-sample processing times were lower for scale (13.88 min) and otolith techniques (12.23 min) than for fin ray techniques (22.68 min). The comparable processing times of scales and otoliths contradict popular belief and are probably a result of the high proportion of regenerated scales within samples and the ability to infer age from whole (as opposed to sectioned) otoliths. This research suggests that while scales produce age estimates rivaling those of otoliths for younger (age , 3) cohorts, they may be biased within older cohorts and therefore should be used with caution.},

The maximum estimated age was 48 years. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the seasonal changes in otolith marginal increments showed that annuli in fish of all ages were laid down each spring, and 1 October was assigned as the birthday. The thin-sectioning method was validated by comparing age estimates for 55 Murray cod from Lake Charlegrark (age 0-21 years), which had been validated by using burnt and polished half-otoliths. The new method had an accuracy of 96.4\% and it offers major advantages in ease of preparation, reading, and batch-handling of large numbers of otoliths. The precision of the method, estimated as an average error for four readers, was 5.4\% (3.0\% after ignoring discrepancies in relation to annuli on otolith edges). There was a linear relationship between otolith weight and fish age and an exponential relationship between otolith weight and fish length. Both otolith length and otolith width reached an asymptote at about 15 years, when fish length also approached its maximum. However, otolith thickness continued to increase throughout the life of the fish and, after about 15 years, contributed most to the increase in otolith weight. This confirmed that otoliths continued to grow in thickness and that annuli were laid down throughout life, and that cod could be aged reliably to the maximum age. The annulus pattern is very clear and distinct, and the reading techniques are fully described, including recognition of 'larval' and 'false' rings. Various differences were found in the growth rates, and the length-weight relationships for males and females, for cod caught in 1986-91 and those caught in 1949-51, and various subpopulations are discussed. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters (all individuals combined) were estimated at L , = 1202 mm, k = O 108 and to= -0.832. The availability of a reliable ageing method provides the first opportunity to determine year of birth and thus to examine the age structure of populations and to effectively manage cod populations that have declined in abundance.},

The aims of this study were to investigate the accuracy and precision of age estimates from transverse sections of sagittal otoliths and to assess effects on these of the geographic area of collection and otolith preparation method. Two independent validation studies suggested an approximately annual formation of annuli in otoliths, predominantly for otoliths with 4\textendash{}10 annuli but also for one otolith with 29 annuli. Otolith sections produced exceptionally high annulus counts: up to 56 annuli for samples from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia; and up to 55 annuli from the Seychelles, indicating a high longevity for this species. The precision of otolith readings from the GBR (index of average percent error, IAPE=3.21$\pm$0.26 S.E.) was within commonly accepted bounds for age estimation (IAPE up to 5\%) but precision of readings from the Seychelles was significantly lower (IAPE=9.18$\pm$0.47 S.E.) and outside of this ``acceptable'' range. Age-based biological parameters for red bass from the Seychelles should thus be applied with greater caution than those for red bass from the GBR. If basic demographic properties are assumed relatively constant across the wide geographic range sampled, however, results from the GBR could be used as more reliable preliminary data for precautionary management strategies in the Seychelles and elsewhere.},

Various methods were used to elucidate growth zones (thin-sectioning, oil and water clearing, staining, and X-ray radiography) to determine the most useful ageing technique for each structure. All calcified structures contained concentric growth zones that increased in number with the size of the fish and were interpreted as annual events. There was a direct linear relationship between size of the structures and size of the fish. Pectoral fin sections were the most practical ageing structure in terms of ease of collection, processing, legibility, and precision of interpretation. Age estimates from other structures resulted in poor precision between readers but relatively good intrareader precision. This suggests possible corroborative use with the development of better interpretive criteria and elucidation techniques. The von Bertalanffy growth curve calculated from age estimates based on pectoral fin sections for all samples produced a growth model for white sturgeon that compared favorably with those from previous studies.},

  abstract = {Golden perch, Macquaria ambigua, from the Murray-Darling Basin were aged by using transverse thin sections of their sagittal otoliths. Samples from 889 fish were obtained from riverine and lacustrine habitats and from wild and stocked populations. Error in the precision of age estimates (calculated as the mean percentage error of the independent age estimates of four readers) was 5.6\% (3.9\% after allowing for discrepancies in relation to the annual mark on the edge of the otolith). Validation was accomplished by using a combination of analysis of the progression of modes in length-frequency distributions, qualitative and quantitative marginal-increment analysis, and analysis of age estimates of fish from populations with a known stocking history. The technique was validated for fish up to 8 years of age (455-545 mm total length, 1695-3988 g total weight), and the greatest recorded age was 16 years (530-600 mm total length, 2607-4050 g total weight). Annual marks become visible in otolith sections in most fish of all ages in October, and 1 October was designated as the birth date. A description of our method of reading sections of golden perch otoliths, including recognition of false annual marks, is given. Otolith length, width and thickness increased linearly with fish length and with loglo(fish age), whereas otolith weight increased linearly with fish age and exponentially with fish length. The continuous growth of the otoliths and the consistency in the appearance of annual marks support the accuracy of estimates up to the maximum recorded age. The mean length-at-age and the parameters of the length-weight relationship were estimated. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were also estimated (L, =507 mm, to=O.420 years, K=O.454). No significant differences were found in growth rates or length-weight relationships between males and females. However, growth (particularly in weight) was highly variable among sites and years, and slow-growing 5-year-olds may be shorter than fastgrowing 1-year-olds. Ages were estimated for a sample of 86 golden perch caught between 1949 and 1951 but a comparison of growth rates between these and more recent collections was inconclusive.},

Determining age based on length-frequency distributions is subjective because of heterogeneity in the growth rates of larval sea lampreys (ammocoetes) within and across streams and the resulting overlap in lengths between age-classes. Statolith-based age assessment methods have never been validated for more than 1 year. We established ``known-age'' ammocoete populations in two streams by introducing a single cohort of spawners above barriers and compared estimates of ammocoete age based on statoliths with the true ages. In five additional streams, we used microsatellite data from adults and ammocoetes to assign parents to ammocoetes produced the same year and compared the age determined by statolith-based interpretation with the age based on parentage assignment. We combined length-frequency data with age composition data from streams having known-age populations and evaluated likelihood-based statistical models used to estimate the age composition of the ammocoete population. Multiple independent age readings of statoliths from known-age sea lampreys indicated that the age assessment bias (average percent error) was 24.3\textendash{}36.2\%. Genotype-based ages differed from statolith-based ages in 36.1\% of cases across all streams. Bias-corrected statolith ages, when combined with length-frequency data, substantially increased age assessment accuracy in a known-age population stream and increased precision in a randomly selected stream; their use, however, requires knowledge of the magnitude of the bias of statolith-based age assessment in study streams. Further effort is needed to quantify these biases and generalize to different types of streams before a reliable methodology for age assessment will be available for sea lamprey management.},

In case of C. catla highest percent agreement was found between opercular bone and scale age estimates. In L. rohita each of the ageing structure showed significant (P $<$ 0.05) underestimation of age in comparison to scales. In C. catla mean age estimates from opercular bone were comparable (P $>$ 0.05) to the values obtained from all other structures except dorsal fin rays. In C. marulius mean age estimates from scales were comparable (P $>$ 0.05) to those from all other structures except from dorsal fin rays. Results indicated scales to be the most suitable structure for ageing L. rohita and C. marulius and opercular bone for C. catla.

Significant positive correlations were observed between the size of left and right statoliths from individuals. Principal components analysis indicated an allometric relationship between lamprey length and statolith size as well as a potential species grouping based on these measurements. Discriminant analysis was able to correctly classify more than 94\% of Pacific lampreys and 92\% of western brook lampreys based on lamprey length and statolith size, and Pacific lamprey statoliths tended to be larger than western brook lamprey statoliths for lampreys of a given size. Reader bias in age estimates of statoliths was greater for older lampreys. Multiple independent age readings of both statoliths from individual lampreys indicated that the overall average percent error was 16.7\% for Pacific lampreys and 33.0\% for western brook lampreys. Within-individual average percent error ranged from 5.1\% to 20.1\% among species and readers. Within-reader average percent error ranged from 6.4\% to 17.8\% among species and readers. The average percent error observed in this study was greater than that observed in studies of other species of lampreys; however, statoliths that were ambiguous or difficult to read were not excluded from this study. In general, the modal separation of age-groups observed in length-frequency distributions for lampreys is poor, as seen in this study; therefore, statolith-based ages may verify or provide better estimates of population age structure. These data demonstrate that estimates of precision are necessary before management actions founded on statolith-based age structure determination are implemented.},

The goal of this study was to compare three hard structures (scales, otoliths, and dorsal fin spines) for estimating the ages of yellow perch Perca flavescens in an unexploited population in a sanctuary of Pymatuning Reservoir, Pennsylvania. Scales, dorsal fin spines, and sagittal otoliths were removed from 107 yellow perch, prepared, and examined by two independent readers. Ages assigned by the two independent readers agreed 96\% of the time when using otoliths, 83\% when using scales, and 80\% when using spines. Pairwise comparisons (paired t-tests, $\alpha$ = 0.05) indicated no significant differences among the ages assigned using the three methods. Otoliths were the best structure to use for estimating yellow perch age based on high reader agreement and low coefficient of variation (CV). However, we found that scales and dorsal fin spines can be used to adequately describe the age structure of yellow perch populations (CV $<$ 10\% for each structure), although dorsal fin spines were slightly more precise than scales for fish assigned to age 4 or older by using otoliths. Thus, use of both dorsal fin spines and scales for yellow perch age and growth studies may improve the precision of population age structure estimates.},

Recent stock assessment studies in the northeast United States indicate that the biomass of the thorny skate is below the threshold levels mandated by the Sustainable Fisheries Act. In order to gain insight into the life history of this skate, we estimated age and growth for thorny skates, using vertebral band counts from 224 individuals ranging in size from 29 to 105 cm total length (TL). Age bias plots and the coefficient of variation indicated that our aging method represents a nonbiased and precise approach for the age assessment of A. radiata. Marginal increments were significantly different between months (KruskalWallis P$<$0.001); a distinct trend of increasing monthly increment growth began in August. Age-at-length data were used to determine the von Bertalanffy growth parameters for this population: L$\infty$ = 127 cm (TL) and k= 0.11 for males; L$\infty$ = 120 cm (TL) and k= 0.13 for females. The oldest age estimates obtained for the thorny skate were 16 years for both males and females, which corresponded to total lengths of 103 cm and 105 cm, respectively.},

Several studies have assessed accuracy and precision of these structures; however, results have been conflicting.

Therefore, our objective was to assess bias, precision, and processing time of otoliths and pectoral spines used for age estimation of channel catfish.

A subsample of these structures was used to estimate and compare processing times. Otoliths displayed greater precision and less reader bias compared to pectoral spines. Age-specific bias was observed for pectoral spines in relation to otoliths, with pectoral spines greatly underestimating ages for age-11 and older channel catfish. Total processing time was greater for otoliths (12.26 min Ϯ 1.09 [SE]) compared to pectoral spines (11.01 min Ϯ 0.07 [SE]). These results provide managers with information to make decisions on which structure to use for age estimation of channel catfish given a known bias and precision desired for statistical analyses and amount of time allotted for the aging process.},

Radiometric ages closely agreed with age estimates from counting growth increments, which confirms their annual periodicity. Radiometric results indicate the Pacific grenadier can live at least 55.8 years (\textendash{}7.4, +10.1 years). Growth increment counts from large fish indicate longevity may approach 73 years.

In common with the majority of shelf slope and deepwater species, there is a paucity of biological and life history information available on this species. No information is available on the growth and maturation rates, with the closest comparative material being from commercially retained Callorhinchus species from New Zealand. A total of 62 specimens (10 male, 52 female) were collected non-randomly, by at-sea observers in the Rockall Trough and Faroe-Shetland Channel (ICES areas; 27 IVa, VIIb and VIIc) in August and October 2001 from the hauls of commercial fishing vessels. Specimens ranged in size from 26 cm to 74 cm pre-supra caudal fin length. The range of maturity was from juvenile to mature for both sexes. Dorsal fin spines were removed and serial cross-sections were used to establish the optimum position of section. Growth increments were counted in ground and polished transverse sections, and four readers conducted 3 independent readings of each section. The estimated ages ranged from 3 to 30 years and 4 to 26 years, for males and females, respectively. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters of Chimaera monstrosa were: L$\infty$ = 78.87 (cm), K = 0.0673 per year and t0 = -2.513 (yr). These parameters, together with the estimated ages, indicate that Chimaera monstrosa is a long lived, late maturing species. A significant relationship between the corrected total spine length and the estimated age was determined. As the removal of the dorsal fin spine is a simple technique, which does not decrease the commercial value of the fish, this method could provide a useful tool for the interim determination of age prior to confirmation by more detailed techniques.},

The position of the first annulus was validated through the otolith radii of known-age juveniles. Marginal increment analysis was performed by examining the growing edge of otoliths over 2 years. This showed that opaque zones were formed annually and were consistently deposited from late September to early December (spring season), which is coincident with annual increases in somatic growth and water temperature during this season. A criterion was developed to ensure accurate age estimation for individuals sampled during the time of year when deposition of opaque material was incomplete or not apparent. The maximum age estimated was 20 years and the relationship between fork length and age was described by the von Bertalanffy growth function (L$\infty$ = 368 mm, K = 0.116 and t0 = -1.87 for males and L$\infty$ = 385.7 mm, K = 0.109 and t0 = -1.96 for females).

To facilitate the progression of further age and growth studies for this commercially important species, the effectiveness of caudal thorns as a rapid ageing tool was assessed. Twenty-eight male and 24 female thorny skates were collected off Greenland, covering the full size range of the species. Replicate age readings of crystal violet stained vertebral sagittal sections and whole silver nitrate stained caudal thorns revealed mean intra-reader age reading precision was higher for caudal thorns (Covariance (CV): reader 1 = 9.07, reader 2 = 9.73) than vertebrae (CV: reader 1 = 14.91, reader 2 = 14.27). Age bias plots revealed minimal inter-structure bias, apart from a higher average thorn age reading of 0.76 years from age classes 5\textendash{}11 years for reader 1. Minor inter-reader bias was evident for vertebrae only; averaging 0.90 years higher for reader 1 from age classes 11 to 15 years. Preliminary evidence suggests caudal thorns could prove an effective non-invasive ageing tool for thorny skates.},

In Lake Ontario, we estimate ages of rainbow smelt annually to study population dynamics such as year-class strength and age-specific growth and mortality. Since the early 1980s, we have used pectoral fin rays to estimate rainbow smelt ages, but the sectioning and mounting of fin rays are time and labor intensive. Our objective was to assess the feasibility of using otoliths rather than fin rays to estimate rainbow smelt ages. Three readers interpreted the ages of 172 rainbow smelt (60\textendash{}198 mm total length) based on thin sections of pectoral fin rays, whole otoliths with no preparation, and whole otoliths that had been cleared for 1 month in a 70:30 ethanol : glycerin solution. Bias was lower and precision was greater for fin rays than for otoliths; these results were consistent for comparisons within readers (first and second readings by one individual; three readers were used) and between readers (one reading for each reader within a pair). Both otolith methods appeared to misclassify age-1 rainbow smelt. Fin ray ages had the highest precision and provided the best approximation of age estimates inferred from the Lake Ontario population's length frequency distribution and from our understanding of this population.},

  abstract = {The age and growth dynamics of the spinner shark (Carcharhinus brevipinna) in the northwest Atlantic Ocean off the southeast United States and in the Gulf of Mexico were examined and four growth models were used to examine variation in the ability to fit size-at-age data. The von Bertalanffy growth model, an alternative equation of the von Bertalanffy growth model with a size-at-birth intercept, the Gompertz growth model, and a logistic model were fitted to sex-specific observed size-at-age data. Considering the statistical criteria (e.g., lowest mean square error [MSE], high coefficient-of-determination, and greatest level of significance) we desired for this study, the logistic model provided the best overall fit to the size-at-age data, whereas the von Bertalanffy growth model gave the worst. For ``biological validity,'' the von Bertalanffy model for female sharks provided estimates similar to those reported in other studies. However, the von Bertalanffy model was deemed inappropriate for describing the growth of male spinner sharks because estimates of theoretical maximum size (L$\infty$) indicated a size
much larger than that observed in the field. However, the growth coefficient (k= 0.14/yr) from the Gompertz model
provided an estimate most similar to that reported for other large coastal species. The analysis of growth for
spinner shark in the present study demonstrates the importance of fitting alternative models when standard
models fit the data poorly or when growth estimates do not appear to be realistic.},

Otoliths were more accurate than scales for estimating the correct age of fish. Back-calculated estimates of fish lengths at given ages based on otoliths were significantly less than those based on scales. Hatchery fish grew faster than wild fish at younger ages. Overall, growth of wild fish was slower than in other areas where Yellowstone cutthroat trout are endemic.

  abstract = {Scales and otoliths (sagittae) were taken from a sample of 137 white crappies (Pomoxis annularis) collected by fyke netting from Ft. Supply Reservoir, Oklahoma, in November 1982. Scales and otoliths from each fish were aged independently by three experienced scale readers, none of whom had prior experience aging otoliths. The average percent error and coefficient of variation of the scale method was approximately seven times greater than for the otolith method, indicating a greater degree of precision for the otolith method. No differences were observed in back-calculated lengths derived from measurements obtained from the right versus left otolith. No significant differences in back-calculated lengths up to age 3 for a given year class sampled in successive years were observed for white crappies aged by the otolith method. These results indicate that age and growth data generated from the otolith method would be sufficiently consistent for biologists to recognize yearly trends in growth variations. Known-age white crappies, needed to verify the accuracy of the otolith technique, were unavailable. However, scales and otoliths were taken from 31 white crappies collected from the James River arm of Table Rock Lake, Missouri, in spring 1984. The scale method for aging white crappies in Missouri is considered to be accurate by the Missouri Department of Conservation. The ages of these fish, as determined by scales read in Missouri and otoliths aged in Oklahoma, were in agreement for 30 of the 31 fish sampled. The use of the otolith method for aging white crappies in Oklahoma is recommended over the scale method. Once field personnel become efficient in extracting otoliths, processing time in the field is only slightly greater than when taking scale samples. No elaborate preparation procedures are required because ages can be obtained from whole otoliths.},

Among-reader variation was similar for spines, scales, and rays, and lowest for otoliths. Variation increased with fish total length (TL) for otolilhs and scales. Age estimates from scales, spines, and rays were usually within 1 year of the otolith age estimate for striped bass shorter than 900 mm TL. However, for striped bass longer than 900 mm TL, estimates from spines and scales were lower than estimates from otoliths by averages of 1.6 and 3.0 years, respectively. Scales, spines, and rays can provide relatively accurate and precise age estimates for striped bass up to about 900 mm TL (age 10 from our samples). For longer fish, the choice of a structure for age determinations should depend on whether the improved accuracy and precision expected from otoliths is worth killing the fish.},

We examined otolith sections of common carp to validate their utility for age determination.

We confirmed the annual periodicity of annulus formation for common carp in a mark\textendash{}recapture experiment when 19 recaptured adult common carp (from an original stocking of 141 fish marked by injection with oxytetracycline [OTC]) showed visible fluorescent marks on their otoliths. Time at liberty for these fish ranged from 6 to 25 months, and their ages on recapture ranged from 3 to 14 years. Increment counts outside the OTC mark agreed completely with time at liberty. We calculated precision estimates on age determinations as the average percent error (APE) and estimated the coefficient of variation (CV ϭ Ϫ0.15 ϩ 1.41APE) between readers and for each of two readers over time. Precision was assessed by rereading subsamples. The APE was less than 5\% and CV was less than 8\% in all cases.

However, routine age interpretation remains largely subjective. A reference collection of 300 red snapper otoliths was circulated among seven external laboratories in the Gulf of Mexico region to compare ages against our internal laboratory determinations. A precision benchmark of average percent error (APE; estimate of precision) $\leq$5\% has been suggested for moderately long-lived species such as red snapper. APE ranged from 2.5 to 6.0\% for six facilities with no apparent bias in estimates as age increased. One initial estimate was notably higher with an APE of 11.6\% and bias was evident. Beyond the need for initial training to recognize annulus patterns in decades-old fish, common differences between readers were related to interpretation of the otolith edge type and to interpretation of the first annulus. Precise measurement of annulus distances and identification of otolith edge patterns aided by light reflectivity measurements indicated that annual rates of transition from translucence to opacity were consistent. However, annual differences in the seasonal timing of otolith zone transition occurred on the order of a few months (this study and others). The degree of opacity varied in the first annulus, but the distance from the core to the distal edge of the first annulus was consistently around 1mm (mean=1.05mm; S.D.=0.11). By recognizing possible variations in these patterns and with use of periodic reader training and a reference collection, our expectation is that a 5\% APE precision target can be readily achieved and improved upon.},

  abstract = {Estimates of age and growth of the white crappie Pomoxis annularis in Mississippi were based on 2,162 sets of scales and otoliths and on 4,196 length samples. The maximum ages identified were 8 years from otoliths, 7 from scales, and 6 from length-frequency analysis with the computer program MIX. Ages assigned to scales and otoliths by two readers agreed 79 and 91\% of the time, respectively. Ages assigned to scales and otoliths taken from the same fish agreed only 74\% of the time. Ages determined from scale and otolith samples obtained from known-age white crappies disagreed because the scales had developed a false annulus. At age 1, but not at older ages, estimates of growth derived from otoliths were significantly (P s 0.05) higher than those derived from scales. Growth estimated from length-frequency modes was generally slower than that estimated from scales or otoliths, but it was significantly slower only at age 1. Unless length samples are obtained during the period of annulus formation, length modes probably will incorrectly estimate length at age. Despite discrepancies among age and growth estimates provided by the three methods, population statistics derived from estimates the methods provided were similar. We suggest that otoliths be used to estimate age and growth of white crappies. Alternatively, if the application allows for reduced accuracy, or if releasing fish alive is a major concern, the scale and length-frequency methods can provide age and growth data that yield population statistics sufficiently similar to those produced by otoliths to be useful in assessing fisheries.},

Thus, an alternative body structure may reduce variability in aging this species and provide more accurate estimates of the growth history and age structure of river carpsucker populations. We compared the precision of age determinations and means of back-calculated lengths at age of river carpsuckers between two readers and between the use of scales and dorsal fin ray sections from 172 individual fish collected in the Missouri River. Age agreement between the two readers was 71\% for both scales and fin rays. Similarly, age agreement between scales and fin rays within readers was 68\% and 72\%. Precision of age determination by both readers declined after age-5 for both structures. Generally, more annuli were detected on fin rays than scales as fish age exceeded 5 years. Means of back-calculated lengths for ages 1\textendash{}4 were significantly greater (P Ͻ 0.05) for fin rays than scales. Excluding ages lacking agreement between scales and fin rays had no significant influence (P Ͼ 0.05) on back-calculated length-at-age estimates. We recommend the use of scales as the primary aging structure when growth and mortality dynamics of the young and most abundant age-classes (e.g., age Յ6 years; total length Յ400 mm) are the primary interest. If estimates of annual mortality are to be extended to older age-classes, fin rays should also be collected on river carpsuckers greater than 400 mm.},

Therefore, our objective was to use marginal increment analysis to validate annulus formation in pectoral fin rays of shovelnose sturgeon collected from the Missouri River. We also compared the precision of age estimates between two different readers. Marginal increment distance indicated that for most of the populations an opaque band was laid down in pectoral fin rays during the summer. However, opaque bands were formed throughout the year in some individuals, which could be problematic when using fin rays for age estimation. The agreement of age estimates by two readers for shovelnose sturgeon was only 18\%, and differences in ages between the two readers increased for older fish. The presence of split annuli, false annuli, spawning bands, imbedded rays, and deteriorating sections made individual growth rings difficult to separate. Our findings verified that opaque bands are formed annually during the summer in the pectoral fin rays of most shovelnose sturgeon, but some individuals form opaque bands during other times. Pectoral fin rays will probably continue to be the most practical method of age estimation in shovelnose sturgeon, but ages estimated by this method should be used with caution.},

The position of the initial fin ray annulus of swordfish was verified for the first time with the use of scanning electron micrographs of presumed daily growth increments present in the otoliths of juveniles. Fish growth through age 7 was validated by marginal increment analysis. Faster growth of females was confirmed, and the standard von Bertalanffy growth model was
identified as the most parsimonious for describing growth in length for fish greater than 60 cm EFL. The observed growth of three fish, a year-old in size when first caught and then recaptured from 364 to1490 days later, is consistent with modeled growth for fish of this size range.

  abstract = {Age and growth of the swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in Taiwan waters was studied from counts of growth bands on cross sections of the second ray of the first anal fin. Data on lower jaw fork length and weight, and samples of the anal fin of male and female swordfish were collected from three offshore and coastal tuna longline fishing ports on a monthly basis between September 1997 and March 1999. In total, 685 anal fins were collected and 627 of them (293 males and 334 females) were aged successfully. The lower jaw fork lengths of the aged individuals ranged from 83.4 to 246.6 cm for the females and from 83.3 to 206 cm for the males.

The radii of the fin rays and growth bands on the cross sections were measured under a dissecting microscope equipped with an image analysis system. Trends in the monthly marginal increment ratio indicated that growth bands formed once a year. Thus, the age of each fish was deter-mined from the number of visible growth bands. Two methods were used to estimate and compare the standard and the generalized von Bertalanffy growth parameters for both males and females. The nonlinear least square estimates of the generalized von Bertalanffy growth parameters in method II, in which a power function was used to describe the relationship between ray radius and LJFL, were recommended as most acceptable. There were significant differences in growth parameters between males and females. The growth parameters estimated for females were the following: asymptotic length (L$\infty$) = 300.66 cm, growth coefficient (K) = 0.040/yr, age at zero length (t0) = \textendash{}0.75 yr, and the fitted fourth parameter (m) = \textendash{}0.785.

Such data for northern-form Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma have been traditionally garnered using otoliths, despite little research investigating the consistency of this or alternative nonlethal techniques. To address these gaps, the precision of age determinations generated from scales, otoliths, and fin rays was examined for 126 amphidromous Dolly Varden collected from two Arctic rivers. Three independent readers, age-bias plots, coefficients of variation (CVs), and percent agreement (PA) were used to estimate bias and precision for among-reader, withinstructure comparisons and within-reader, among-structure comparisons. Among-reader, within-structure tests of CVs suggested that otoliths produced more precise age determinations than fin rays. Furthermore, the CV for scales was intermediate to and not significantly different from those for otoliths and fin rays. Agebias plots suggested that, scales consistently underestimated age relative to otoliths beginning at age 6. Underestimation was also apparent, but less distinct, within fin ray\textendash{}otolith and scale\textendash{}fin ray comparisons. Potential sources of error and management implications are discussed. Because scale and otolith ages exhibited little bias within cohorts younger than age 6, age may be determined nonlethally in these cohorts using scales; otoliths should be used otherwise.},

Scale age had an overall accuracy of 81.8\% and was biased high (v2 \textonequarter{} 8.67; P \textonequarter{} 0.014). Fin ray age had an overall accuracy of 98.6\% and was unbiased (v2 \textonequarter{} 2.00; P \textonequarter{} 0.34).

For two age composition scenarios, age classification errors were greatest when using scales and least when using fin rays. Aging errors inflated the size of weak cohorts in simulated run reconstructions. We showed how this can cause large errors in estimates of smolt-to-adult return rate when run strength and age composition vary among years. The amount of error associated with scale aging then becomes problematic for tracking the status of both threatened and healthy salmon stocks. Data based on fin ray readings provided the most accurate, unbiased estimates of age structure. Correction for methodological bias is important if age data are to be used in rigorous analyses.},

  abstract = {To combat the potential deleterious effects that Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix have on native populations, management of this species is essential. Before developing population-level models, a determination of which aging structure for estimating the age of Silver Carp is needed. To our knowledge, no consensus has been reached on which structure should be used for estimating Silver Carp ages. We collected 120 Silver Carp from the Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers via electrofishing to evaluate aging structures. Removal time, processing time, and discernible annuli were evaluated for scales, opercles, vertebrae, pectoral fin rays, postcleithra, and asterisci and lapilli otoliths. Asteriscus otolith, opercle and scale annuli were difficult to discern and not evaluated further. Total processing times for postcleithra (246.1 s) and lapilli (251.2 s) were the most time-efficient; pectoral fin rays and vertebrae were more time intensive. Between-reader precision and agreement rates resulted in lapilli being the most precise, followed by postcleithra, pectoral fin rays, and vertebrae. Comparisons of structures with lapilli revealed that pectoral fin rays exhibited 78\% agreement, 49\% agreement with postcleithra, and 53\% agreement for vertebrae. In terms of agreement $\pm$ 1 year to lapilli, pectoral fin ray, postcleithrum, and vertebra resulted in high agreement ($>$85\%). Age bias plots revealed that these discrepancies consistently underestimated ages compared with lapilli. Discrepancies may be attributed to erosion of the central lumen of fin rays and postcleithra, while locating the first annulus on vertebrae may have led to this disparity. Based on previous studies, evaluation of overall processing times, assessment of between-reader precision, between-reader agreement rates, and bias that may be involved with alternative structures, we recommend lapilli otoliths be used for estimating age of Silver Carp. Future efforts should focus on validating accuracy of lapilli for estimating Silver Carp ages.},

By thin-sectioning the opercula, we removed the dense bone, revealing previously obscured annuli. Using opercula collected from older fish in Labrador, Canada, we found that the dense bone overgrowth led to an overall age bias of 1 year. When samples were broken into groups based on sectioned ages, however, there were minimal differences in age between the two techniques for fish age 6 and younger and a 2-year age difference for fish estimated to be age 10 and older. To compare precision in locating annuli between the two techniques, we calculated coefficient of variation values among independent determinations. Both techniques demonstrated low variance, however, age determinations had greater variation with thin-sectioning than with whole opercula interpretations. Therefore, we conclude that care must be taken when making annulus determinations from thin-sectioning. Due to the presence of dense bone overgrowth, associated with the whole operculum technique, we conclude a combination of both techniques would provide the most thorough procedure for interpreting opercular age for such long-lived fish (30\textendash{}50 years).},

  abstract = {It has been well documented in previous research that otoliths are the preferred hard structure for estimating age in coregonids. However, the slower growth due to short growing seasons experienced by populations in the subarctic region of the boreal zone may alter the utility of alternative nonlethal structures for estimating age. We compared the three most commonly used age estimation structures (otoliths, pectoral fin rays, and scales) for Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis in a northern (above 50 N) population from Great Slave Lake. This study provides new perspectives regarding the use of different aging structures with fish populations typical of subarctic and arctic environments. Results of ANOVA showed that reader confidence, within-reader precision, and the age estimates themselves were all affected by age structure; reader confidence also varied with age-class. Reader confidence was highest for age estimates from otoliths, followed by pectoral fin rays and then scales. Similarly, within-reader precision (as measured by CVs) was highest for age estimates from otoliths, followed by scales and then pectoral fin ray sections. Pairwise comparisons between age estimates from otoliths and those from scales or pectoral fin rays indicated no significant differences when fish were younger than 10 years (scales) or 12 years (fin rays), suggesting that these nonlethal structures could be conservatively used to reliably estimate ages of younger ($<$10 years) and smaller ( 300 mm FL) Lake Whitefish. Of particular significance are the findings that (1) divergence between scale and otolith age estimates is delayed by 5\textendash{}6 years relative to more southerly populations; and (2) in contrast to examples from southern populations, fin rays do not offer a suitable nonlethal alternative for estimating ages of older Lake Whitefish ($>$11 years).},

  abstract = {Management agencies often estimate the ages of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides based on the examination of scales\textemdash{}a structure that is known to produce biased estimates\textemdash{}without knowing how the associated bias affects management decisions. We sought to understand the effects of this bias by comparing population metrics that were predicted using scale-derived and otolith-derived age data. We collected scales and otoliths from Largemouth Bass that were sampled during standard electrofishing surveys. The age of each fish was estimated independently by three separate readers using both scales and otoliths. We assessed the average coefficient of variation for scale-derived and otolithderived age estimates, examined the bias of scale-derived age estimates, and estimated von Bertalanffy growth model parameters by using ages estimated from scales and otoliths. These parameter estimates were used in yield-per-recruit simulations that predicted yield and the percentage of individuals in the cohort surviving to 380 mm (proportional size distribution [PSD] 380) or to 470 mm (PSD 470) at several levels of natural mortality and fishing mortality. Otolith-derived age estimates were more precise; scale-derived age estimates showed significant positive bias for fish younger than age 6 and significant negative bias for fish older than age 6. Von Bertalanffy parameter estimates were significantly different when using ages estimated from scales and those estimated from otoliths. Modeling indicated that estimates of yield and PSD 380 resulting from the two structures were similar. However, the use of scale-derived ages resulted in underestimating the impact of fishing mortality on PSD 470 by as much as five times at low levels of natural mortality and fishing mortality. Our estimates of precision and bias were similar to other comparisons of scales and otoliths, and the results of our yield-per-recruit simulations are likely generally applicable for Largemouth Bass management. Trophy fishing is a common management objective, and managers relying on scale-based age data could be less likely to adopt the restrictive harvest regulations that are critical for producing trophy Largemouth Bass.},

  abstract = {Accurate age estimation is important for understanding salmonid population dynamics and managing fisheries. In this study, we validated the age of Brown Trout Salmo trutta in four Driftless Area streams of southwestern Wisconsin using otoliths from known-age fish. We tagged and released known age-1 Brown Trout with coded wire tags in spring 2010\textendash{}2015. Age-1 Brown Trout were identified by length and verified by identifying a single annulus in a subsample of otoliths. Brown Trout were recaptured 1 to 5 years after tagging to extract otoliths for aging and coded wire tags to identify known age. We used three readers to independently estimate age using otoliths for 249 Brown Trout, and we quantified bias and precision. Complete agreement (all readers assigned the same age) was 74\%, partial agreement (at least two readers assigned the same age) was 98\%, and consensus agreement with known age (all readers agreed on a consensus on age when assigned ages differed) was 93\% with a coefficient of variation of 9.4\%. Consensus agreement by age varied from 81\% for age 3 (n = 31) to 98\% for age 1 (n = 132) and 100\% for age 5 (n = 6). We conclude that using otoliths is a valid approach for estimating the age of Brown Trout ages 1\textendash{}5 in productive streams as found in Wisconsin's Driftless Area and that the use of multiple readers and consensus agreement can improve aging accuracy.Received Feburary 6, 2017; accepted May 5, 2017Published online June 30, 2017},

Results showed that accuracy of age estimation methods varied among structures: 85.68\% of otoliths, 68.91\% of scales, 49.25\% of pectoral fin rays, and 27.67\% of opercular bones yielded age estimates that were consistent with the actual fish ages.

Age estimates can be used to estimate recruitment, relative abundance of age-groups, total mortality, and growth. Because of difficulty in estimating Northern Pike Esox lucius ages using scales and whole cleithra, we compared precision and bias of age estimates from whole cleithra, sectioned cleithra, metapterygoid bones, otoliths, and scales. Metapterygoid bones and sectioned cleithra represent two novel structures for estimating ages in North America, and the assessment of otoliths is limited. Complete agreement and consensus agreement rates were greatest for otoliths, sectioned cleithra, and metapterygoid bones. Otoliths provided the most precise age estimates and whole cleithra were the least precise. Consensus age estimates for sectioned cleithra were lower than whole cleithrum estimates. Consensus age estimates from sectioned otoliths were lower than mean age estimates from scales, sectioned cleithra, and whole cleithra, and y-intercepts from the age-bias plots were significantly different than zero. We suggest that otoliths, sectioned cleithra, and metapterygoid bones can be used to estimate Northern Pike ages, but recommend the use of sectioned otoliths because they had the highest precision and otoliths have become a common means of estimating ages for many species.Received December 8, 2015; accepted March 31, 2016 Published online July 20, 2016},

  abstract = {As a long-lived and late-maturing species, Atlantic Sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus are susceptible to overharvest, which makes knowledge concerning their age and growth essential to sustainable management. The Saint John River, New Brunswick, and the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, support the two remaining commercial fisheries for Atlantic Sturgeon in North America; however, the relationship between age and growth has not previously been modeled for the Saint John River population. Ages of Saint John River Atlantic Sturgeon were estimated by using pectoral fin spine sections collected from 262 individuals of known TL. Most (87\%) of the pectoral spine sections were aged by two readers to evaluate possible reader bias. An age\textendash{}bias plot and coefficient of variation (CV) indicated relatively low between-reader precision (CV = 5.6\%) compared with that reported in other studies. Von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM) parameters were estimated for males (n = 67), females (n = 85), and the combined sexes. Unsexed juveniles and subadults smaller than 150 cm TL (n = 110) were used for the lower part of each curve. The growth models indicated that (1) males reached maximum length sooner than females and (2) females continued to grow more as adults to greater lengths (males: Brody growth coefficient K = 0.06, asymptotic length L$\infty$ = 230 cm TL; females: K = 0.04, L$\infty$ = 264 cm TL). As predicted, the VBGM parameters estimated for combined sexes of the Saint John River stock (K = 0.05, L$\infty$ = 254 cm) were intermediate to those of Atlantic Sturgeon from the Hudson and St. Lawrence rivers, in agreement with a previously observed latitudinal trend in growth.Received June 26, 2014; accepted January 13, 2015},

Previous studies on comparison of age estimation methods of walleyes Stizostedion vitreum have shown otoliths are the best method overall and that dorsal spine cross sections are a suitable alternative to scales, the most commonly used method. We compared ages estimated from scales, dorsal-spine cross sections, and otoliths for unexploited walleyes from Pymatuning Sanctuary, Pennsylvania. We collected these structures from fish sampled in trap nets during the spawning run in March and April 1997. Two readers independently examined these structures without knowledge of fish length or gender. Otoliths provided the best agreement between readers for both genders (94\% for females, 86\% for males) and dorsal-spine cross sections provided the poorest agreement (63\% of females, 62\% of males). Younger ages were estimated from scales than from spines, and this difference was greater for males than for females. Age estimates from both scales and dorsal spines agreed poorly with age estimates from otoliths for both sexes. Ages estimated from scales were consistently lower than ages estimated from otoliths, especially after age 4; differences between ages estimated from otoliths versus spines were inconsistent. We concluded that otoliths are the best method of age estimation for this population and that scales are the best alternative for fish less than 500 mm long. This research underscores the need to validate age estimates with fish of known age and to test multiple age estimation methods when beginning research on previously unstudied populations.},

Age and growth of North Pacific albacore (Thunnus alalunga) was assessed by examining annual growth increments in sagittal otoliths from 486 fish collected in different regions of the North Pacific Ocean. A wide size range of albacore (52\textendash{}128 cm fork length, FL) was collected in an attempt to incorporate size-at-age information over juvenile, sub-adult, and adult life history stages. Overall, ages ranged from 1 to 15 years, with the majority of fish between 2 and 4 years of age. Growth models fit otolith-based size-at-age well, and Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample size indicated that the specialized von Bertalanffy (VB) model provided the best fit. The estimated biological parameters of the specialized VB model were L$\infty$ = 124.1 cm FL, K = 0.164 year-1, and t0 = -2.239. Daily ages were also determined and verified correct age-1 assignments for fish 55\textendash{}61 cm FL, with daily ages ranging from 378 to 505 days. In addition, dorsal fin spines and length frequency (LF) analysis were used to obtain estimates of size-at-age and corroborated results from otolith-based techniques. Modeling exercises resulted in nearly an order of magnitude difference in spawning stock biomass (SSB) when comparing growth parameters obtained from this study relative to previous stock assessment models of North Pacific albacore. Results suggest North Pacific albacore is a relatively long lived tuna species and provide updated biological parameters useful for future stock assessment models.},

Annulus marks were validated using marked-recaptured fish, oxytetracycline injections, and edge analysis. A subset of fish was sacrificed to compare the scale, spine and ray ages to otolith ages. A 40\% recapture rate provided a useful time series of in situ age and growth data. Scale and ray ages were unreliable, but dorsal spines demonstrated agreement with corresponding otolith ages. Annuli were best represented by translucent bands in spines, as opposed to opaque bands in otoliths. Spines were positively validated for periodicity of annulus formation. Annuli formed at different times of the year in spines than in otoliths. By correcting for this difference using a biological age method, better agreement between otolith and spine age was achieved. Dorsal spines are recommended as the primary method for ageing goliath grouper between the ages of 0 and 6 yr. This study illustrates the use of a non-lethal method to determine age of a protected species.},

  abstract = {This study investigated whether teeth and dorsal fin spines could be used as non-lethal methods of age estimation for a vulnerable and highly valued tropical fisheries species, coral trout Plectropomus leopardus. Age estimation of individuals from 2 to 9 years old revealed that dorsal spines represent an accurate ageing method (90\% agreement with otoliths) that was more precise [average per cent error (APE) = 4$\cdot$1, coefficient of variation (c.v.) = 5$\cdot$8\%] than otoliths (APE = 6$\cdot$2, c.v. = 8$\cdot$7\%). Of the three methods for age estimation (otoliths, dorsal spines and teeth), spines were the most time and cost efficient. An aquarium-based study also found that removing a dorsal spine or tooth did not affect survivorship or growth of P. leopardus. No annuli were visible in teeth despite taking transverse and longitudinal sections throughout the tooth and trialling several different laboratory methods. Although teeth may not be suitable for estimating age of P. leopardus, dorsal spines appear to be an acceptably accurate, precise and efficient method for non-lethal ageing of individuals from 2 to 9 years old in this tropical species.},

We sampled 4976 individuals, with length and weight data collected from 2000 to 2008. We analysed the ages of 535 sailfish, with their individual growth estimated by using two models. The first was the Schnute generalized-growth model and the second was the von Bertalanffy growth function. The parameters in each model and their confidence intervals (CI) were computed. The best candidate model was selected using Akaike's information criterion. We found the growth curve for sailfish from the Gulf of Tehuantepec is based on the three-parameter model rather than the generalized Schnute model. The parameters estimated and confidence intervals were (1) mean asymptotic eye\'Afork length 0180.6 cm (CI 0176\'A186 cm), (2) Brody growth coefficient 00.36 (CI00.34\'A0.39), and (3) hypothetical age at length zero 0(0.24 (CI 0(0.30 to (0.18).

  abstract = {Background. Gymnocypris firmispinatus Wu et Wu, 1988 is a small fish with the maximum total length of 242 mm, which occurs only in the Jinsha River and its tributaries (China), at altitudes above 2000 m. Nowadays, G. firmispinatus had been placed in a dangerous situation, due to hydropower station and excessive fishing. However, attempts to develop an effective population management strategy have been obstructed by lack of basic biological information, especially for age estimation. As we known, sectioned otoliths provide the most precise age estimates of many Schizothoracinae fishes, vertebrae and opercular bones were also used for age determination of some fish species. This work aimed to assess the suitability of three calcified structures (otolith, vertebra, and opercular bone) for age estimation of G. firmispinatus. Materials and methods. The annulus characteristics of otolith, vertebra, and opercular bone were described. Annual periodicity was verified by marginal increment ratio (MIR) analysis in otoliths and edge analysis in vertebrae and opercular bones. Otoliths, vertebrae, and opercular bones were examined to determine which structure produced the most precise and accurate age estimates in G. firmispinatus, mainly by scoring for readability on a five-point scale and calculating the index of the mean percentage error (IMPE).
Results. Microscopically, otoliths and vertebrae showed a typical pattern of opaque-and translucent-zones, attributed to slow and fast growth periods. Annuli formed between March and May once a year in otoliths and vertebrae. Forty-four percent of the opercular bones were scored as unreadable. The value of IMPE between the two counts was lowest for otoliths (4.25\%), followed by vertebrae (6.21\%) and opercular bones (11.58\%). The IMPE value of vertebra vs. otolith was 11.05\%, while that of opercular bone vs. otolith was 23.03\%. Vertebrae and otoliths matched closely only for the first 4 years of life, while opercular bones appeared to underestimate the age of G. firmispinatus.
Conclusion. Annuli in the otoliths and vertebrae both formed once a year up to age 8, and otoliths would be the most precise structure for age determination in G. firmispinatus. Vertebrae and otoliths matched closely up to age 4, while opercular bones could not be used for age estimation for the species.},

  abstract = {Historically, Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus suckleyi) have been aged using dorsal fin spines, a method that was validated through bomb radiocarbon analysis and oxytetracycline tagging. However, ages generated using this method generally have poor precision and require estimation of missing growth bands in eroded spines, prompting a search for improved age determination methods. In the present study, spiny dogfish were aged using the historical spine method and a new method involving stained thin sections of vertebral centra. Results of an inter-laboratory exchange demonstrated the need for readers to calibrate ageing criteria with a reference collection before reading structures, a practice that yielded significant improvements in between-reader precision of spine band pair counts. After calibration, the primary readers examined the full sample set. The two structures yielded similar age estimates for younger animals, but centrum estimates were consistently younger than spine estimates after age-10. Although further work is necessary to fully explore potential reasons for the observed bias, such as centrum size and location within the vertebral column, at the present time centra are not a suitable alternative to dorsal fin spines for age determination of Pacific spiny dogfish .10 years of age.},

  abstract = {Background. Shark populations within the eastern Mediterranean are declining due to overfishing. Unfortunately, our knowledge on the biology of sharks and specifically dogfishes within eastern Mediterranean is extremely limited due to the lack of landings. Mustelus mustelus (Linnaeus, 1758) is one of such deficiently known cartilaginous fishes and the relevant information on its age and growth in the eastern Mediterranean is missing. The understanding of growth and reproductive behaviour is important for management and conservation of this species. The presently reported study was intended to determine age, growth, and some reproductive parameters of Mustelus mustelus collected in the Gulf of Iskenderun, the north-eastern Mediterranean Sea. Materials and methods. In this study, a total of 155 Mustelus mustelus were caught in the north-eastern Mediterranean Sea between March 2012 and October 2015. Fish age was determined based on band counts of sectioned vertebrae. The periodicity of band pair formation was examined using the marginal increment analysis. Growth parameters for all specimens were then determined by fitting the observed and the length-at-age data using the von Bertalanffy Growth Equation. The size and age at which 50\% of both sexes reached maturity was estimated by a logistic model for maximum likelihood process and the gonadosomatic index was determined.
Results. The total length and weight of the specimens examined ranged from 44.3 to 162.6\,cm and from 241.3 to 12 060\,g, respectively. The presently reported study provides new maximum lengths (162.6\,cm) for M. mustelus from the north-eastern Mediterranean. The fish studied represented age groups from 0 through 25. The observed sex ratio was 1 $\div$ 1.04 (females $\div$ males). Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated to be L$\infty$\,=\,195.13\,cm, W$\infty$\,= \,20 060\,g, K\,=\,0.06, and t0 = -4.27 for all specimens. Length\textendash{}weight relation was found to be W = 0.0027L3.0054 (R2 = 0.98) and 95\% confidence intervals of b = 2.936\textendash{}3.075, t-test P $<$ 0.05. All studied specimens of M. mustelus represented isometric growth (b = 3). Condition factor ranged from 0.148 to 2.87 for females and from 0.103 to 1.024 for males. The length at 50\% maturity and the age at 50\% maturity were 109\,cm and 8 in females and 92\,cm and 7 in males, respectively. It was observed that mean GSI values were low in September and July, reaching a maximum in January to February.
Conclusion. The results of this study could give useful insight for management plans and conservation of M. mustelus in the Mediterranean coast of Turkey.},

  abstract = {Background. Bastard grunt, Pomadasys incisus (Bowdich, 1825), is reported as a well-established species in the Mediterranean Sea. Although bastard grunt has rapidly expanded its area of distribution in the Mediterranean, there is no information about its age and growth. The aim of this study was to provide data about growth, condition, and first sexual maturity of the species in order to contribute to a better management of its fishery. Materials and methods. A total of 515 specimens of bastard grunt were caught in the Gulf of Tunis. The age was determined from otoliths. Length\textendash{}weight relation, von Bertalanffy equation, and growth rate were employed to evaluate the fish growth. Also the condition factor and length at first sexual maturity were calculated.
Results. In the Gulf of Tunis population, females were significantly predominant and the overall sex ratio (M : F) reached the value of 1 : 2.17. The two sexes showed a positive allometric growth. The marginal increment analysis validated the annual deposition of one single annulus in the winter. Growth in (total) length (TL) was approximately 65\% during the first year of life. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was TL = 23.9 \texttimes{} (1 \textendash{} e\textendash{}0.186 \texttimes{} (t + 4.62)). The somatic condition of fish increased markedly during the late spring and summer. Length at first sexual maturity of the bastard grunt was 16.6 cm for males and 16.8 cm for females, which correspond to an age of about 2 years.
Conclusion. The rapid growth during the first year of life, the early maturity and the moderately short life cycle contribute to the relatively fast spreading of the species.},

  abstract = {Background. The small red scorpionfish, Scorpaena notata Rafinesque, 1810, appears as a bycatch of Portuguese fisheries. Bycatch species are likely to suffer the same declines as commercial species with which they co-occur but information on those species for Portuguese waters does not exist. In order to increase the knowledge for the Portuguese continental-shelf waters several aspects of the species growth were investigated. Materials and methods. Age and growth of Scorpaena notata from Portuguese continental-shelf waters were studied using 379 otoliths. A subsample of 70 otoliths, covering all length classes, was read by three of the authors to establish a reading and interpretation pattern. The von Bertalanffy growth model was fitted to sex-specific age\textendash{}length data. The likelihood ratio tests were used to evaluate the significance of differences on growth parameters between sexes and with the parameters estimated in different areas.
Results. Females dominated in smaller length classes while males prevailed in larger ones, although overall sex ratio did not deviate from 1 : 1. Females ranged from 10.5 to 18.8 cm total length (TL) and from 1 to 6 years; males ranged from 11.4 to 20.7 cm TL and from 1 to 7 years. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated for the Portuguese shelf waters showed significant differences between sexes and were: L$\infty$ = 18.23 cm TL, k = 0.43yr\textendash{}1, t0 = \textendash{}0.99 yr for females and L$\infty$ = 21.17 cm TL, k = 0.28yr\textendash{}1 and t0 = \textendash{}1.73 yr for males. The age range found in the Portuguese shelf waters was similar to that found in the Balearic Islands but about half of that found for the Adriatic Sea. Significant differences between growth parameters from the Portuguese coast and those from the Balearic Islands and Adriatic Sea were found.
Conclusion. Estimates of L$\infty$ in the presently reported study were the highest but rather consistent with the maximum length given for the species.},

  abstract = {Background. Age determination is a basic step in understanding fish biology and dynamics of fish populations. The only available data on the age and growth of argentine, Argentina sphyraena Linnaeus, 1758, a noncommercially exploited species of the family Argentinidae, was published almost half a century ago. More recent reports are limited to general biological characteristics of A. sphyraena so the main goal of our study was to fill a gap by investigating age and growth of the eastern Adriatic population of this fish. Materials and methods. Samples of the argentine were collected in the eastern Adriatic Sea, during March 2011, using a bottom trawl. We analysed sagittal otolith morphology and morphometry; the age of each fish was determined from the number of growth zones on otoliths and relations between the observed otolith age and otolith morphometrics were constructed using a power model. Mean length-at-age was described using the von Bertalanffy growth model.
Results. Sagittal otoliths of Argentina sphyraena displayed alternating opaque and translucent zones. The maximum observed age was 3 years for both females and males. Females that were 2+ and 3+ years old were the most numerous in the sampled population. The estimated values of the von Bertalanffy growth model parameters were: L$\infty$ = 17.57 cm; k = 0.40 year\textendash{}1; t0 = \textendash{}1.39 years. The age of the argentine can be best predicted from the otolith thickness.
Conclusion. The maximum lengths and ages recorded in this study confirmed that in warmer southern latitudes, Argentina sphyraena attains a smaller maximum size. It should be emphasized that the presented model described the growth of fish ages 1\textendash{}3 and therefore is probably representative only for younger age groups of argentine.},

  doi = {10.3750/AIP2014.44.4.02},
  abstract = {Background. The peacock wrasse, Symphodus tinca (Linnaeus, 1758), is a common Mediterranean fish and the most abundant labrid species on the eastern coast of Algeria. Its age and growth, however, have been poorly studied. Such data are essential for proper fisheries management. The aim of this study is to provide information on the age and growth of this wrasse species from the eastern Algeria based on two different methods of fish age determination. Materials and methods. Age and growth of Symphodus tinca were determined by examining otoliths and scales of the fish sampled between January and December 2011 on the eastern coast of Algeria. Otoliths and scales from 515 and 469 specimens, respectively, were used to determine the age using commonly accepted procedures.
Results. The age was successfully determined in 513 (99.61\%) otoliths (277 females, 209 males) and in 428 (91.25\%) scales (232 females, 173 males), representing age classes between 0+ and 5+ years (1+\textendash{}3+ years for females and 1+\textendash{}5+ years for males). The validity of the otolith and scale readings for estimating age and growth was supported by the back-calculation method. The success rate in reading otoliths and scales of Symphodus tinca was very high. The growth pattern is well described by the von Bertalanffy growth equation: from otoliths, L$\infty$ = 26.46 cm, k = 0.79, t0 = \textendash{}0.12 for females and L$\infty$ = 32.32 cm, k = 0.54, t0 = \textendash{}0.22 for males; from scales, L$\infty$ = 26.61 cm, k = 0.61, t0 = \textendash{}0.45 for females and L$\infty$ = 32.50 cm, k = 0.48, t0 = \textendash{}0.31 for males. Otolithometry and scalimetry gave very close results. The total lengths (TL) ranged from 4.9 to 31.3 cm, and eviscerated weight (We) from 1.38 to 400.65 g. The length\textendash{}weight relation showed an isometric growth for females (b = 3.01), and negative allometric growth for males (b = 2.86).
Conclusion. The age was estimated by otolith and scale reading for males and females where the two methods yielded the similar results. Although the otolith readings presented a better fit (99.61\%), scales could also be used with fairly good results (91.25\%). In the future, research on the growth of S. tinca either of these two methods can be used to save time. The scale method, however, is certainly the easiest.},

  abstract = {Background. Understanding the life history of a species is essential for fully understanding its role within an ecosystem. However, many of the fish species of high ecological value have not been studied due to their less prominent roles in local recreational and commercial fisheries in comparison to other targeted species. These valuable fishes are also important trophic linkages between small neritic fishes and large, economically valuable apex predators. This study describes for the first time the yearly age and growth patterns of three small tuna species inhabiting South Florida (USA) waters: blackfin tuna, Thunnus atlanticus (Lesson, 1831); little tunny, Euthynnus alletteratus (Rafinesque, 1810); and skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis (Linnaeus, 1758). Materials and methods. Tuna specimens were collected in two ways: via donations obtained from various fishing tournaments and charter captains in the areas of the Florida Straits as well as hook-and-line catches performed especially for this project. Age determination was based on sagittal otolith hyaline deposition patterns. Marginal increment analysis was used as an indirect validation method. Growth parameters were determined by comparison of the fish fork length and the hyaline band measurements.
Results. Two hyaline bands formed each year in all three species\textemdash{}one in winter and one in summer. The von Bertalanffy growth equation produced a growth rate for each species: blackfin tuna, L$\infty$ = 95.34 cm, K = 0.28, and t0 = \textendash{}1.53; little tunny, L$\infty$ = 77.93 cm, K = 0.69, and t0 = \textendash{}0.69; and skipjack tuna, L$\infty$ = 112.76 cm, K = 0.24, and t0 = \textendash{}1.70. Parameters of each resulting von Bertalanffy equation were compared among species showing that little tunny grew the fastest, but skipjack had the largest estimated size. Results were also compared with growth rates currently used in stock assessments by fisheries management organizations, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).
Conclusion. Sectioned otoliths indicate two bands a year for these three species in the Florida Straits. Results were comparable to other studies, with a similar finding of two bands per year in hard parts for these species. Further knowledge of these populations will aid in stock assessments for these species and the ongoing shift to ecosystem-based management plans.},

  abstract = {Abstract Fish age is useful to fishery managers when evaluating growth rates, mortality rates, and reproduction. Our objective was to determine whether two methods for estimating the age of saugers Sander canadensis using dorsal spines?side illumination and spine sectioning?resulted in similar age estimates at the same efficiency and cost. To do this, we determined whether the coefficients of variation (CV = 100 $\cdot$ SD/mean) differed between age estimates of fish using the two techniques in the Missouri River and a portion of the Kansas River. We found that the CVs did not differ significantly between techniques. While reader agreement did not differ significantly, side illumination took one-half as much time as sectioning. In addition, side illumination displayed outer annuli on older fish better than sectioning and did not require an expensive low-speed saw, microscope slides, or a mounting medium for processing. We conclude that side illumination is the most time- and cost-efficient method for estimating sauger ages from spines.},

Otolith sections not only can provide accurate age estimates and back-calculated length estimates for young walleye populations but also they are easier to age, and consequently are more accurate for determining ages of older walleyes than are scales and dorsal spines.},

  abstract = {Validated estimates of age are presented for albacore Thunnus alalunga, sampled from a large part of the south-western Pacific Ocean, based on counts of annual opaque growth zones from transverse sections of otoliths. Counts of daily increments were used to estimate the location of the first opaque growth zone, which was completed before the first assumed birthday. The periodicity of opaque zones was estimated by marginal increment analysis and an oxytetracycline mark\textendash{}recapture experiment. Both validation methods indicated that opaque zones formed over the austral summer and were completed by autumn to winter (April to August). The direct comparison of age estimates obtained from otoliths and dorsal-fin spines of the same fish indicated bias, which was assumed to be due to poor increment clarity and resorption of early growth zones in spines, resulting in imprecise age estimates. As such, age estimates from otoliths are considered to be more accurate than those from spines for T. alalunga. This is consistent with results for a growing number of tropical and temperate tuna Thunnini species. It is recommend that validated counts of annual growth zones from sectioned otoliths is used as the preferred method for estimating age-based parameters for assessment and management advice for these important stocks.},

When whole otolith and broken-burnt otolith ages were compared, high agreement within structures and low precision between structures were observed.

  title = {Ageing Precision and Error Analysis of Whole-View and Sectioned Otoliths in {{Largemouth Bass}} and {{Spotted Bass}}},
  volume = {1},
  abstract = {The objectives of this study were to quantify ageing precision for largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and spotted bass (M. punctulatus), and to evaluate the effect of ageing errors on the estimation of common fisheries metrics. Sagittal otoliths were extracted from 2164 largemouth bass and 738 spotted bass collected from throughout the Arkansas River, Arkansas. Largemouth bass collections occurred during 2004, 2005, and 2010; spotted bass collections were limited to 2004 and 2005. Annuli were counted by two independent readers from digital images of each whole otolith. For individuals aged greater than 2 yrs from whole views, otoliths were transverse sectioned through the focus and polished, with the cross-sectional surfaces imaged and re-aged. Precision between readers of both whole-view and sectioned otoliths was determined for all ages, whereas precision between ages generated from whole-view and sectioned otoliths also was determined. Precision between readers of whole-view otoliths averaged 95\% for largemouth bass and 93\% for spotted bass, whereas between-reader precision of sectioned otoliths was 92\% for largemouth bass and 94\% for spotted bass. Between-method precision of spotted bass ages averaged 91\%. Although between-method precision of ages averaged 84\% overall for largemouth bass, precision declined noticeably from 89\% during 2004\textendash{}2005 to 66\% in 2010. Between-method precision suggested that the practice of sectioning otoliths from age-3 and age-4 individuals may be overly conservative for black basses in most instances. Sectioning fewer black bass otoliths should translate into a significant time savings for fisheries researchers. Using a pooled largemouth bass dataset, simulated ageing errors produced $\leq$5\% differences in von Bertalanffy growth and $<$10\% in catch-curve mortality parameters. Observed differences of this magnitude should be tolerable for basic fisheries assessments and many forms of largemouth bass management, though the error may be too large for certain modeling efforts. Results also indicated that spotted bass may be reliably aged using procedures similar to those recommended for largemouth bass.},

A total of 625 individuals [total length (TL) ranging from 7 mm to 510 mm] were sampled at the Paranagu\'a Estuarine Complex (PEC) and adjacent coastal areas over a year (August 2015 to July 2016). Age estimation based on sagittal otolith cross section showed that C. faber has a 17-year longevity close to its southern distributional limit, two times greater than previously reported from the North Atlantic Ocean. Sexual growth dimorphism was not evident as the male:female sex ratio was 1:1.17. The species displayed asymptotic growth. Fitted von Bertalanffy growth function estimates for all individuals were L$\infty$ = 508.81 mm, k = 0.22 year-1, and t0 = -0.05 year. The histological gonadal examination and gonado-somatic index indicated that C. faber is a batch spawner with a main reproduction period from October to January in subtropical latitudes at 25$^\circ$S. Postovulatory follicles were often recorded in the ovaries of spawning capable individuals indicating a high frequency of spawns over the reproductive period. The data also suggest that estuaries are important reproductive areas for this species that most likely exhibits a seasonal movement for spawning aggregation purposes. Females mature approximately 0.5 years later than males and are capable of spawning just prior to two years old. Fishery closures during the spawning season and fishing size restrictions should be used to manage the C. faber stock in southern Brazil. The effects of current harvest levels are unknown and warrant further investigation to assist management decisions.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the precision of age estimates generated by different readers and different calcified structures is an important part of generating reliable estimations of growth, recruitment, and mortality for fish populations. Understanding the potential loss of precision associated with using structures harvested without sacrificing individuals, such as scales or fin rays, is particularly important when working with imperiled species, such as Cycleptus elongatus (Blue Sucker). We collected otoliths (lapilli), scales, and the first fin rays of the dorsal, anal, pelvic, and pectoral fins of 9 Blue Suckers. We generated age estimates from each structure by both experienced (n = 5) and novice (n = 4) readers. We found that, independent of the structure used to generate the age estimates, the mean coefficient of variation (CV) of experienced readers was approximately 29\% lower than that of novice readers. Further, the mean CV of age estimates generated from pectoral-fin rays, pelvic-fin rays, and scales were statistically indistinguishable and less than those of dorsal-fin rays, anal-fin rays, and otoliths. Anal-, dorsal-, and pelvic-fin rays and scales underestimated age compared to otoliths, but age estimates from pectoral-fin rays were comparable to those from otoliths. Skill level, structure, and fish total-length influenced reader precision between subsequent reads of the same aging structure from a particular fish. Using structures that can be harvested non-lethally to estimate the age of Blue Sucker can provide reliable and reproducible results, similar to those that would be expected from using otoliths. Therefore, we recommend the use of pectoral-fin rays as a non-lethal method to obtain age estimates for Blue Suckers.},

The apparent periodicity of ridge deposition suggests that caudal thorns exhibiting this sculpture have potential for use as ageing devices. Caudal thorns and vertebrae were removed from selected specimens. Thorn surface band counts were compared with counts from longitudinal sections of vertebral centra. Structures were read three times by each of three readers in a double-blind study. Differences in precision were found between readers. Estimates made by the most experienced reader showed least variation. A consistent difference between thorn and centrum band counts was recorded in the males of two species, with centrum counts lower than thorn counts by one growth increment. These differences were attributed to difficulties in interpreting the centrum sections of these species. In all other groups, counts were highly correlated with no significant difference between group means. Caudal thorns represent a novel ageing structure that provides estimates with precision similar to that of more conventional vertebral ageing techniques. Centrum and thorn edge analysis, supported by evidence from a tetracycline-marked individual of a related species, confirms the nature of band formation in both structures. The use of thorns as ageing structures, where appropriate, has the potential to be of significant benefit to the resource assessment and management of skate and ray fisheries.},

Bands were counted by two readers who used information on the diameter of the vertebrae of new-born young and 1-year-old juveniles to identify the inner bands. The greatest estimated age was 12.1 years for a female of 137 cm total length, but few rig were more than 8 years old. For west coast South Island (WCSI) rig, there was no significant difference in growth rates of males and females. After pooling both sexes, there was no significant difference in growth rates between WCSI and east coast South Island (ECSI) rig. The combined WCSI and ECSI von Bertalanffy growth curve was Lt = 147.2 (1 \textendash{} e -0.119[t + 2.35]). This curve agreed well with growth curves derived from length\textendash{}frequency data, but validation of the ageing technique is still required. WCSI males mature at \textasciitilde{}85 cm and 5\textendash{}6 years, and females at \textasciitilde{}100 cm and 7\textendash{}8 years. ECSI rig probably mature at similar lengths and ages.

Vertebrae from school shark were more difficult to read than those from gummy shark. The number of increments an experienced reader counted on the external surface of alizarin-stained whole vertebral centra was consistent with the number of major hypermineralized increments counted on microradiographs of vertebral sections. Differences between increment counts obtained by four different readers were significant. Increment counts by experienced readers were more precise and less biased between repeated readings. Increment counts from vertebrae sampled in the same region of the vertebral columns were not significantly different. Increment counts from vertebrae sampled in different regions were significantly different and were highest for vertebrae from the thoracic region. Differences in increment counts between regions of the vertebral column may distort von Bertalanffy growth curves and therefore affect the reliability of fisheries stock assessments based on age-structured population models.},

  abstract = {Dorsal spines, otoliths, scales, and vertebrae collected from yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) in NSW, Australia, were assessed for usefulness in estimating age. Legibility of growth zones, the time scale at which zones form, and precision of age estimates were evaluated for fish sizes from 323 to 1090 mm FL. All calcified structures contained growth zones, but dorsal spines were unsuitable for age determination because it was likely that early growth zones were lost. From marginal increment analysis, it appeared that one zone was laid down per year for otoliths and possibly scales, but a clear pattern was not found for vertebrae. Although exact agreement between repeated age readings was relatively low (50\textendash{}66\%), agreement within one zone was higher (92\textendash{}96\%) and scales provided the most precise readings. Precision decreased with increasing age of fish. Growth curves derived from otoliths and scales were similar for all ages except fish from the first age class; those derived from otoliths and vertebrae were similar for all fish with less than eight growth zones. Although statistical differences were found between the growth curves of scales and vertebrae for some age classes, with the exception of the first age class these differences were not biologically important. Growth rates estimated from length-frequency (agebased) and mark-recapture (lengthbased) data compared favorably with those estimated from calcified aging structures. Otoliths, scales, and vertebrae all showed promise as structures for aging kingfish, but further work is needed to determine the position of the first zone and to validate estimates for all age classes. Until such work is completed, we recommend that scales and either otoliths or vertebrae be used for aging kingfish.},

We considered the following criteria: processing time, reader confidence, reader agreement (precision), agreement of mark counts between structures, and growth with presumed age. Processing time\textemdash{}more than 1 h per fish\textemdash{}was unreasonably high for sectioned pectoral fin rays, so we did not evaluate their use further. Sectioned dorsal fin spines were clear and easy to read, but mark counts disagreed with those of other structures and were not significantly related to the growth of the fish or that of the aging structure. Scale marks often were inconsistent, which led to low confidence and low agreement between readers. Scale ages also showed systematic disagreement with sectioned-otolith ages. Reader confidence was relatively low for whole-otolith age readings in comparison with sectioned readings of the same otolith, and whole-otolith ages showed systematic disagreement with sectioned-otolith ages. Sectioned otoliths were far superior to all other structures in all criteria: marks were clearest, reader confidence was highest, agreement was 100\% both within and between readers, and both fish size and structure size increased significantly with presumed age. Consequently, we recommend that sectioned otoliths be the preferred structure for determining the age of spotted seatrout.},

Age and growth were estimated from seasonally formed bands on the first dorsal spines of 380 specimens (45\textendash{}191cm FL) obtained from 1998 to 2000. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated from the observed length-at-age, from back-calculated lengths, and from a combination of back-calculated lengths and observed lengths. This last method was chosen for describing the species' growth; parameters were L$\infty$ = 230.7cm, K = 0.267, and t0 = -0.081 year. Marginal increment ratio and spine edge characterization suggested the annual deposition of two bands. Mean MIR values increase from November to April and from June to September, whereas translucent edges predominate in May and October, when new band formation is supposed to start. Overall, spines showed one to six complete bands with a well-developed absorbed area. The estimated reading error (IAPE) between two examiners was 9\% for the overall sample. Size at maturity corresponded to an age of 3.4 years and the oldest individual in the sample was 6.5 years (191cm FL). Fish lengths (35,469), taken from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna\textendash{}ICCAT database and measured in the area 20$^\circ$S\textendash{}05$^\circ$N from 1975 to 1994, were analyzed leading to results similar to those produced from reading spines. Comparisons with von Bertalanffy parameters from the literature indicated statistical differences among all growth curves, with exception of that presented for the northern Atlantic. Average fish lengths decreased from 1975 to 1994, and only 25\% of individuals in landings were larger than the size at maturity.},

  abstract = {Trotlines were used to capture pallid sturgeon in the free-flowing Mississippi River, which extends from the Gulf of Mexico to the mouth of the Missouri River. Trotlines were baited with worms, and set overnight usually along the channel border. The pectoral fin rays of 165 pallid sturgeon caught in the Mississippi River were aged; 118 were from the lower Mississippi River (LMR) between the Gulf and mouth of the Ohio River, and 47 were from the middle Mississippi River (MMR) between the mouths of the Ohio and Missouri rivers. Initial agreement within $\pm$1 year between two readers ranged from 53\% for the LMR specimens, which were read first, to 84\% for the MMR. Final age was agreed upon by both readers. For LMR pallid sturgeon, final age estimates ranged from 3 to 21 years with a mean ($\pm$SD) of 11.0 $\pm$ 4.7. For MMR pallid sturgeon, final age estimates ranged from 5 to 14 years with a mean of 9.5 $\pm$ 2.1. Seven pallid sturgeon marked with coded wire tags (CWT), indicating hatchery origin, were collected in the MMR. Age estimates for CWT fish were 7\textendash{}8 years representing 1997 stocked fish, and 11\textendash{}12 years representing 1992 progeny stocked in 1994. Von Bertalanffy growth equations for length indicated that pallid sturgeon in the MMR had higher growth rates for a given age than pallid sturgeon in the LMR. However, there were no significant differences (anova, P $>$ 0.5) in the length\textendash{}weight relationships between reaches. In the LMR, pallid sturgeon fully recruited to trotlines at age 11 and instantaneous total mortality (Z; slope of catch curve) was estimated at -0.12 (n = 10 year classes, r2 = 0.55, P = 0.01). Of the 118 sectioned rays from the LMR, 28 could not be reliably aged (only one section from the MMR could not be aged). Therefore, age was predicted from length using the von Bertalanffy equation. The catch curve was re-calculated using the predicted ages of the 28 pallid sturgeon in the LMR resulting in Z = -0.07. In the MMR, pallid sturgeon fully recruited to trotlines at age 9 and Z was estimated at -0.36 (n = 6 year classes, r2 = 0.67, P = 0.04), which was significantly higher (anova, P = 0.04) than the LMR estimate. Higher mortality in the MMR may be due to habitat limitations compared to a larger, more diverse channel in the LMR, and incidental take of larger, older individuals during commercial harvesting of shovelnose sturgeon. Commercial take of shovelnose does not occur in the LMR except in the northern portion of the reach. Considering the presence of pallid sturgeon with CWT, recruitment of older individuals in the MMR may have been influenced by stocking a decade earlier. Management strategies for this endangered species should consider the differences in mortality rates among reaches, the impacts of commercial fishing on recovery of pallid sturgeon in the MMR, and the long-term effects of hatchery fish now recruiting into the free-flowing Mississippi River.},

Various non-lethal hard structures for estimating age of Common Carp have been evaluated, but a comprehensive evaluation of the precision of age estimates and relative readability among widely-used hard structures is lacking. We verified age estimates obtained from asteriscus otoliths, scales, pectoral fin rays, and dorsal fin spines of 207 Common Carp from Crane Creek Reservoir and Lake Lowell in southwestern Idaho. Between-reader precision, readability, and differences in age estimates among hard structures were evaluated. Percent agreement (PA) was lower and the coefficient of variation (CV) was higher for otoliths (PA = 18.4\%; CV = 17.6) and scales (PA = 29.7\%; CV = 15.4) compared with pectoral fin rays (PA= 51.7\%; CV = 4.9) and dorsal fin spines (PA = 65.2\%; CV = 3.0). Both readers displayed higher confidence in estimating age using dorsal fin spines than pectoral fin rays. In general, age estimates from scales and otoliths were lower than both pectoral fin rays and dorsal fin spines. Between-reader analysis showed high exact and within-1 year agreement, low CV, and higher confidence ratings for age estimates obtained from dorsal fin spines when compared with the other hard structures. Dorsal fin spines provide the most repeatable estimates of Common Carp age and annuli formed on dorsal fin spines were easily read. Thus, understanding Common Carp population age structure and growth can be achieved using dorsal fin spines.},

Oxytetracycline mark-recapture methods (MR), marginal incremental analysis (MIA), and comparisons across multiple populations were used to evaluate the utility of two structures for aging redband trout in high desert streams. We assessed periodicity of annulus formation on scale and otolith samples from all age classes of trout residing in two streams, identified the location of the first annulus on otoliths, and compared age estimates and between-reader coefficient of variation on nine additional streams. The use of MIA successfully validated opaque zone periodicity for fish transitioning from age-0 to age-1, and from age 1 to age 2 in two streams. For fish at liberty 13 and 28 months in the same two streams, MR-derived age estimates from whole and sectioned otoliths were 94\textendash{}100\% accurate for fish from 2\textendash{}9 years old. Scales were only 77\% and 38\% accurate for fish at liberty 13 and 28 months, respectively. Between-reader coefficient of variation (CV) for scales was high (11.5\%), while CV for sectioned otoliths using whole otoliths as corroboratory structures averaged 2.3\%.

Longnose Gar Lepisosteus osseus is a large, ubiquitous top predator in fresh and saline waters of the eastern United States. Even though the species is common, their basic biology has been largely uncharacterized in brackish and marine waters. Specimens were collected from two estuaries: Winyah Bay and Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, from May 2012 through July 2013 to examine age, growth, and reproduction in tidally influenced systems. This species is fairly long-lived, with maximum ages of 17 and 25 years for males and females, respectively. The von Bertalanffy growth model yielded significantly higher growth rates for males than for females. Reproductive histology and the gonadosomatic index indicated that Longnose Gars exhibit determinate fecundity and spawn in late spring following a long development period during fall and winter. These life history parameters provide valuable insight into the basic biology of Longnose Gars and into how they function in estuarine environments. Further research on the precise timing and location of spawning movement, as well as daily movement patterns of this species, would provide a more comprehensive knowledge of Longnose Gar reproductive biology.},

Marginal-increment and edge analyses of Nile tilapia otoliths from Lake Nabugabo indicated formation of two annuli per 12-month period. Opaque zones associated with faster growth were observed between April and June and between September and December, coincident with the two rainy seasons of the year. Within both lakes, males were larger at age than females. Nile tilapia from Lake Nabugabo, however, had faster growth rates than Nile tilapia from Lake Wamala, and fish $>$3 years old from Lake Nabugabo were larger at age than those from Lake Wamala. Ages ranged from 0 to 8.0 years for Nile tilapia from Lake Nabugabo, and from 0.5 to 6.5 years for tilapia from Lake Wamala. Differences in the patterns of growth in Nile tilapia between lakes may reflect, at least in part, the relatively energy-rich omnivorous diet of Nile tilapia in Lake Nabugabo versus a phytoplanktivorous diet in Lake Wamala. Diet differences of Nile tilapia between the two lakes are ascribed to trophic changes in the lakes due to the introduction of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) into Lake Nabugabo but not Lake Wamala. Alternatively, the greater exploitation of Nile tilapia in Lake Nabugabo may have resulted in increased growth rates, whereas Nile tilapia in Lake Wamala may be subject to slower, density-dependent growth.},

  abstract = {Sex-specific age and growth were determined for white grunt, Haemulon plumieri (Lacep\`ede, 1801), from their main fishing area on the Gulf coast of Florida. In total, 4043 fish were collected using hook-and-line or trap gear: 2617 from the central and 1426 from the north-central Gulf coast of Florida. White grunt were aged reliably using thin-sections of sagittal otoliths. Both marginal-increment analysis and chemical marking with oxytetracycline indicated that one annulus was deposited in a 12-mo period, with the opaque zone forming mainly during May. Ages of white grunt ranged from 0\textendash{}18 yrs, and fish ranged in size from 7\textendash{}41 cm total length. White grunt from the north-central region were larger at age than those from the central region, and males attained a larger size than females in both regions. Asymptotic lengths of males and females combined ranged from 296\textendash{}343 mm total length. Comparatively, white grunt from the Gulf coast of Florida were of similar size-at-age as fish from southeastern (Atlantic) Florida but were smaller than white grunt from North and South Carolina. Regional growth differences of white grunt are problematic for any comprehensive fishery management plan on a Florida-wide, Gulf-wide, or southeastern U.S-wide basis.},

  abstract = {Historically the Chesapeake Bay supported a large population of Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus, but loss of suitable spawning habitat and overfishing coincided with dramatic in-system declines throughout the 20th century. Atlantic sturgeon harvest moratoriums were implemented in 1974 for Virginia waters and were expanded coastwide in 1998. In 1997, researchers became aware that commercial fishers in the James River, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, were catching juvenile and subadult Atlantic sturgeon as bycatch in various fisheries. Genetic studies showed that the Chesapeake Bay population has maintained genetic integrity and qualifies as a distinct population segment. Between 2007 and 2011, almost 150 adults have been caught in the tidal\textendash{}freshwater portion of the James River during putative spawning runs. Pectoral fin spines from juveniles and subadults collected in the Burwell Bay (rkm 40) and Cobham Bay (rkm 60) areas and mature adult samples from vessel strikes in freshwater around or above rkm 120 were analyzed to create a length-at-age curve for Atlantic sturgeon in the James River. Five models were used to analyze the data, and the double von Bertalanffy (k1 = 0.054, k2 = 0.097, t1 = -2.85, t2 = 1.09, tp = 6.03 years, L$\infty$ = 2241 mm) provided the best fit to the observed data. We estimated an increase in growth coefficient at tp, which could be an artifact of low sample size or due to ontogenetic changes in habitat use as older fish spend more time in oceanic waters than younger fish. Atlantic sturgeon in the 6\textendash{}9 year age range are rarely encountered in the James River compared with younger and older age-classes, so a more in-depth analysis of the increased growth coefficient would require ocean sampling.},

Longevity estimates based on vertebral ageing were 9 and 14 years for male and female C. sorrah and 13 and 15 years for C. tilstoni. However, an age-validation study failed to validate annual banding in larger individuals, suggesting that maximum age may be underestimated by vertebrae. C. sorrah grew to adult size relatively fast, reaching maturity at 2.3\textendash{}2.4 years, whereas C. tilstoni grew slower, reaching maturity at 5.2\textendash{}6.1 years. For both species, however, reproduction did not commence until approximately a year after maturity, at 3.4 years for C. sorrah and 7.2 years for C. tilstoni. The results of the present study suggest that in the GBRWHA, C. tilstoni, in particular, begins reproducing at an older age and lives longer than previously thought.},

Ages of T. zillii ranged from 2 to 8 years, with fish gillnetted offshore having a faster growth and attaining larger size-at-age than fish captured inshore in minnow traps, suggesting that use of multiple gears is needed when estimating the growth of T. zillii.

The west Florida shelf was divided into two regions: north (capture locations $\geq$28$^\circ$N latitude) and south (capture locations $<$28$^\circ$N latitude). Significant differences were found for age, length, and size-at-age by region and by gear; red grouper from the north were significantly younger and smaller on average than those from the south. Regional differences were also noted with respect to age progression; year class trends were only detected in the north. The 1996 year class dominated the landings in 2000\textendash{}2001 (ages 4 and 5) and the 1999 year class dominated in 2004\textendash{}2005 (ages 5 and 6).

Mortality estimates derived from catch curves resulted in higher total and fishing mortality in the north for both gears. Alternative explanations of regional differences likely depend on nursery delineation and correlation to periodic environmental events such as red tides and hurricanes; all possibly important factors based upon anecdotal information. Nevertheless, our finding of regional demographic differences in red grouper from the west coast of Florida suggests a more complex population spatial structure for red grouper.},

In Lake Champlain tributaries, Stonecats are listed as endangered in Vermont but not in New York. Here we describe the growth of Stonecats in two tributaries to Lake Champlain, one in Vermont (LaPlatte River), which was our primary interest, and one in New York (Great Chazy River), with von Bertalanffy growth models fit to lengths at the times of marking and recapture and to observed length and age data. We also compared growth of Stonecats in these waters to results from other locations near the middle of their distribution. Stonecats in the Great Chazy River were larger at ages 1\textendash{}3, but similar in size for ages 4 and 5, than Stonecats from the LaPlatte River. Stonecats in Lake Champlain tributaries were generally larger at age than those from the middle of their range, except for those from Lake Erie. From our mean length-at-age results and previous literature estimates of length at maturity for Stonecats, it appears that Stonecats in Lake Champlain reach maturity by age 3, though future research that directly estimates age at maturity would be more informative. These results will help managers assess the effect of various environmental and human stressors that Stonecats have experienced in the Lake Champlain basin in recent years. Furthermore, our results expand the literature, which lacks information about growth of this species. Finally, our mark\textendash{}recapture approach to estimating growth of Stonecats can be applied to other species, especially where data are limited because of their status, and in other systems.},

  abstract = {We used dorsal spines and otoliths from 735 Walleye Sander vitreus collected from 35 Wisconsin water bodies to evaluate whether 1) otolith and dorsal spine cross sections provided age estimates similar to simpler methods of preparation (e.g., whole otoliths and dorsal spines, cracked otoliths); and 2) between-reader precision and differences between spine and otolith ages varied in relation to total length (TL), sex, and growth rate. Ages estimated from structures prepared using simpler techniques were generally similar to ages estimated using thin sections of dorsal spines and otoliths, suggesting that, in some instances, much of the additional processing time and specialized equipment associated with thin sectioning could be avoided. Overall, between-reader precision was higher for sectioned otoliths (mean coefficient of variation [CV] \textonequarter{} 3.28\%; standard error [SE] \textonequarter{} 0.33\%) than for sectioned dorsal spines (mean CV \textonequarter{} 9.20\%; SE \textonequarter{} 0.56\%). When using sectioned otoliths for age assignment, between-reader precision did not vary between sexes or growth categories (i.e., fast, moderate, slow), but between-reader precision was higher for females than males when using sectioned dorsal spines. Dorsal spines were generally effective at replicating otolith ages for male Walleye ,450 mm TL and female Walleye ,600 mm TL, suggesting that dorsal spines can be used to estimate ages for male Walleye ,450 mm TL and female Walleye ,600 mm TL. If sex is unknown, we suggest dorsal spines be used to estimate ages for Walleye ,450 mm TL, but that otoliths be used for fish .450 mm TL. Our results provide useful guidance on structure and preparation technique selection for Walleye age estimation, thereby allowing biologists to develop sampling guidelines that could be implemented using information that is always (TL) or often (sex) available at the time of fish collection.},

However, the Utah chub has been introduced into many other waterbodies in the western United States, where it competes with ecologically and economically important species. The objectives of this study were to evaluate between-reader precision and reader confidence in age estimates obtained from pectoral fin rays, lapilli (otoliths), asterisci (otoliths), and scales for Utah chubs collected from Henrys Lake, Idaho. Lapilli have been previously shown to provide accurate age estimates for Utah chubs; therefore, we sought to compare age estimates from fin rays, asterisci, and scales to those from lapilli. The between-reader coefficient of variation (CV) in age estimates was lowest and the percent of exact reader agreement (PA-0) was highest for pectoral fin rays (CV = 4.7, PA-0 = 74\%), followed by scales (CV = 10.3, PA-0 = 52.3\%), lapilli (CV = 11.6, PA-0 = 48.2\%), and asterisci (CV = 13.0, PA-0 = 41.7\%). Consensus age estimates from pectoral fin rays showed high concordance with consensus age estimates from lapilli. Our results indicate that pectoral fin rays provide the most precise age estimates for Utah chub. Pectoral fin rays are easily collected and processed and also provide age estimates without requiring fish sacrifice.},

Eastern North Pacific female and male salmon sharks were aged up to 20 and 17 years, respectively.

Multiple versions of two growth models were fitted to length-at-age data, from which a two-phase von Bertalanffy model produced the best fit. For males, the change in growth rate corresponded with size-at-maturity, whereas for females, the change was slightly before size-at-maturity. Regardless of the growth model used, growth rate of females (0.034 to 0.098 years-1) was very low, making S. megalops highly susceptible to overexploitation by fisheries.},

The data were fitted to the von Bertalanffy growth equation after adopting the Francis reparametrization and correcting for sampling bias caused by the selectivity effects of the gill-nets of various mesh sizes used to capture the sharks. The von Bertalanffy growth curves of male and female gummy shark were significantly different, but the growth curves of male and female school shark were not. The growth curves suggest that growth rates of male and female gummy shark in Bass Strait were lower during 1986-87 than during 1973-76 and that the growth rates of male and female gummy shark and school shark in Bass Strait during 1986-87 were lower than those in South Australia at the same time. These apparent temporal and spatial differences in growth patterns of gummy shark are explained by the 'Phenomenon of Apparent Change in Growth Rate'. It is concluded that the growth curves determined for 1986-87 are distorted by the effects of a long history of high and length-selective fishing mortality and that actual growth patterns of gummy shark are better represented by the von Bertalanffy growth equation determined for shark caught in Bass Strait during 1973-76, when fishing mortality was much lower. Verification of age estimates was attempted by comparing von Bertalanffy growth curves derived from age-length data with those derived from tag release-recapture length-increment data, but these comparisons highlight the limitations of using tag data for this purpose. Although reasonable agreement was found between such growth curves for gummy shark, it appears that school shark older than 11 years cannot be aged accurately from stained whole or sectioned vertebrae. Sectioned vertebrae from a school shark recaptured 35.7 years after being tagged and released and calculated as having an age exceeding 45 years gave estimates of only 18-20 years of age.},

Sizes of sampled sharks ranged from 46 to 147 cm pre-caudal length. Four growth models were fitted to length-at-age data; two forms of the von Bertalanffy growth model, the Gompertz growth model, and a logistic growth model. Males and females exhibited statistically significant differences in growth, indicating that females grow slower and attain larger sizes than males. Growth parameter estimates revealed slower growth rates than previously estimated (based on captive specimens) for Hawaiian sandbar sharks. The von Bertalanffy growth model using empirical length-at-birth provided the best biological and statistical fit to the data. This model gave parameter estimates of L\textyen{} = 138.5 cm PCL and k = 0.12 year\textendash{}1 for males and L\textyen{} = 152.8 cm PCL, k = 0.10 year\textendash{}1 for females. Male and female sandbar sharks mature at approximately 8 and 10 years of age, respectively.},

Mean MIR analysis showed that one band is formed annually starting in August. Male and female growth is similar, back-calculated von Bertalanffy parameters were LI  325.4 cm, K  0.075 yr\`A1 and t0  \`A3.342 yr\`A1 for both sexes, whereas observed length-at-age parameters were LI  284.9 cm; K  0.996 yr\`A1, and t0  \`A3.391 yr\`A1. Observed length-at-age described growth better than back-calculated lengths. Maturity is reached for both sexes at 180.0$\pm$190.0 cm, or 6$\pm$7 year-old individuals. The overall sample ranged from a recently born male from the 0 age-class (71.0 cm) to a 17 year-old female (250.0 cm).

Vertebral sections from 131 males (43.5\textendash{}124 cm TL) and 146 females (46\textendash{}146 cm TL) were analyzed. The index of average percentage of error (IAPE) estimated from two readings ranged from 1.61 to 4.83 (mean: 6.66\%) in the vertebrae of specimens between 0 and 15 years of age. The monthly marginal increment (MIR) ratio revealed a tendency toward band pair deposition between autumn and winter, whereas the monthly distribution of growth band pair classes revealed that the first band pair appears on the vertebrae of newborns (ages 0+) about 6 months after birth (by June). This deposition pattern was found in specimens with one, two and three band pairs on the vertebrae (1+ and 2+, respectively), thereby confirming annual band pair completion in winter. Growth parameters were derived using the von Bertalanffy model (VBGM), VBGMb (modified by length at birth: L0), the Richards, Gompertz and Schnute models. No significant differences in growth rates were detected between the two sampling periods (1994\textendash{}1999 and 2004\textendash{}2008). Models with multiple inflection points, particularly the Richards model, best represented growth for the species, which was evidenced by the lowest Akaike information criterion value. There were no differences in growth between sexes. Growth parameters estimated for both sexes were L$\infty$ = 129.34 cm (SE = 1.35), k = 0.24 (SE = 0.009) and m = 1.34 with the Richards model. The ``average'' model was determined by averaging L$\infty$ between the models with substantial statistical support that were considered the most plausible (Richards and Gompertz). Thus, a consensual L$\infty$ = 130.69 cm, estimated by multi-model inference, was employed to minimize the effects of sample size and selectivity. Males and females mature at 6 years of age and the largest specimen in the catches was 15 years of age (132 cm TL). Local fishing exploitation using gillnets caught only juveniles, whereas the longlines used for the surveys caught subadult and adult specimens. C. acronotus is a relatively fast-growing species inhabiting shallow coastal waters throughout its lifespan, which is a pattern to be taken into account in the years to come for the management of coastal exploitation targeting valuable teleosts.},

  abstract = {The age and growth characteristics of black marlin (Istiompax indica) off eastern Taiwan were studied using growth rings on cross sections of the third dorsal spine. Length and weight data, and first dorsal fins were collected monthly at Shinkang fish market in southeastern Taiwan from July 2004 to April 2006. In total, 923 dorsal fins were collected, of which 874 (95\%) (187 males and 687 females) were aged successfully. Trends in monthly mean marginal increment ratios indicated that growth rings formed once a year. Two methods were used to back-calculate lengths of presumed ages, and growth was described using the standard and generalized von Bertalanffy growth functions. The most parsimonious description of growth assumed that length-at-age followed the standard von Bertalanffy function and that the relationship between spine radius and lower jaw fork length (LFJL) followed a power function. Growth differed between males and females. The growth parameters estimated for males were asymptotic length (L$\infty$) = 305.8 cm LJFL, growth coefficient (k) = 0.125 yr-1, age at zero length (t0) = -2.27 yr, and those for females were L$\infty$ = 396.6 cm LJFL, k = 0.094 yr-1, t0 = -1.83 yr. Males were larger than females in the first four years of life, while females attained larger sizes by age 5 and lived much longer than males and consequently grew much larger. The maximum age observed in this study was 11 years for females and 5 years for males. The life span difference between males and females was most likely caused by sex-specific mortality (or differential longevity).},

  abstract = {The spotted ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei) is a chimaeroid ranging from southeast Alaska to Baja California and found at depths of up to 1029 m. Despite being widespread and ubiquitous, few biological parameter estimates exist for spotted ratfish due to a lack of suitable ageing structures to estimate age and growth. We present preliminary results of age, growth and maturity estimates based on a new method in which tritor ridges are counted on the vomerine tooth plate. We also provide a method for estimating the number of worn tritor ridges based on tooth plate diameter measurements for the spotted ratfish. The tritor ridges are distinct bumps that are easy to identify and precision estimates between readers suggests that this method is transferable. Tritor ridges are a potential structure for estimating age in H. colliei and we provide recommendations for future research to improve the method. We sampled 269 spotted ratfish captured in trawl surveys off the coast British Columbia ranging in size from 74 to 495 mm in precaudal length (PCL). The estimated ages ranged from 2 to 16 years for males and from 2 to 21 years for females. The von Bertalanffy, von Bertalanffy with known size at birth, Gompertz and logistic growth models were fitted to the data. Based on Akaike information criterion corrected for sample size and number of parameters estimated, the logistic growth curve was selected as most suitable. The logistic growth model yielded the following parameter estimates: Linf \textonequarter{}407.22 mm (PCL), k \textonequarter{}0.23 year\`A1, t0 \textonequarter{} \`A 7.06 years for males; L1 \textonequarter{}494.52 mm (PCL), k \textonequarter{} 0.26 year\`A1, t0 \textonequarter{} \`A 8.35 years for females. Estimated ages at 50\% maturity were 12 and 14 years for males and females, respectively. Correspondingly, the size at 50\% maturity estimates was smaller for males (302 mm, PCL) than females (393 mm, PCL). Both estimates are larger than those made for spotted ratfish off of California indicating regional differences in life history traits for this species. Our preliminary results suggest that H. colliei is a late maturing species with a moderate growth rate and is moderately long-lived compared to teleosts.},

  abstract = {The determination of age for large, harvested species such as chondrichthyans is important to the estimation of growth and other key life history parameters such as natural mortality, age-at-maturity, longevity, and recruitment. Vertebrae from 760 wobbegongs (275 Orectolobus ornatus, 232 O. maculatus, and 253 O. halei) were collected between June 2003 and December 2007 at seven locations in eastern Australia (Queensland and New South Wales) to estimate growth parameters for these species. A multi-model inference (MMI) information theoretical approach including four candidate models, with back-calculated estimates of length in earlier life stages to account for limited numbers of pup and juvenile wobbegongs, was used to determine the most appropriate growth model for each species. The models that combined observed and back-calculated lengths-at-age did not provide a better fit than the model using observed lengths-at-age data only. Taking into account biologically meaningful estimations of L$\infty$ and k, the models with the best fit to the data were the logistic growth function for O. ornatus and O. halei, and the von Bertalanffy growth model for O. maculatus. Using these models, growth parameters obtained were: 999, 1630 and 2128 mm total length for L$\infty$ and 0.19, 0.09 and 0.20 for k, while the maximum number of growth bands was 20, 22, and 27, for O. ornatus, O. maculatus, and O. halei, respectively. All three species were monomorphic, with similar growth rates for males and females. Verification and validation undertaken using edge and marginal increment analyses, as well as chemical marking of captive and wild wobbegongs, suggested that growth band deposition in orectolobids is more likely to be linked to somatic growth than seasonality. This study is the first to use chemically marked wild Orectolobiformes to investigate growth band deposition rate. Five orectolobid species have now been shown not to deposit growth bands following a synchronous annual pattern, in contrast to that inferred for most other chondrichthyan species. The growth parameters estimated in this study are crucial for stock assessments and for demographic analyses to assess the sustainability of commercial harvests.},

  abstract = {The removal of large predatory sharks from the world's oceans poses profound threats to marine community structure and species conservation. Effective management of exploited shark stocks requires a sound understanding of the life histories of target species. Here we provide the first assessment of age and growth for Carcharhinus brevipinna in Australian waters, and for C. obscurus and C. plumbeus in eastern Australian waters, based on interpretations of vertebral growth bands. In doing so, we provide arguably among the most robust growth parameters to date for the abovementioned taxa on the bases of genetic validation and sample size and distribution, but acknowledge equally a range of limitations\textemdash{}most notably those associated with vertebral ageing and our lack of age validation. Comparatively, the three species displayed both contrasts and consistencies in their growth characteristics off Australia's southeast coast. For all three sharks, rates of growth were greatest in the years immediately after birth, males grew more rapidly than females in the juvenile phase, and females were observed to grow larger, live longer and were generally larger at any given age. Longevity and all modelled growth parameters (L1, k and L0), however, differed among the three species, and appeared to challenge the findings for conspecific populations in other parts of the world. The validity of these latter comparisons is, however, compromised by a range of confounding factors. Nevertheless, we provide the least conservative k estimates for C. obscurus and C. plumbeus of those previously reported, and extend maximum age estimates for C. brevipinna. In this way, our results have important implications for the assessment of natural mortality, productivity, and hence resilience to stock depletion, in these species in southeastern Australian waters.},

Although both criteria produced age estimates consistent, to varying degrees, with different reference chronologies, only one was considered valid when life history information was used to select the appropriate reference chronology and minimum/ maximum ages based on bomb carbon values were taken into consideration. These age estimates, validated up to 44 years, were used to develop a growth curve for the species, which was best described using the Schnute general model (sexes combined).

  abstract = {The scalloped hammerhead, Sphryna lewini (Griffith \& Smith, 1834), is a globally exploited species of shark. In order to gain insight into the life history of this species in the USA waters, age and growth was examined from specimens (n = 307) captured from the north-west Atlantic Ocean and from the Gulf of Mexico. The von Bertalanffy growth model resulted in growth parameters of L$\infty$ = 214.8 cm fork length (FL), k = 0.13 year-1, t0 = -1.62 year for males and L$\infty$ = 233.1 cm FL, k = 0.09 year-1, t0 = -2.22 year for females. The oldest age estimates obtained for this population were 30.5 years for both males and females, which corresponded to FL of 234 cm and 241 cm respectively. Bowker's test of symmetry and Index of Average Per Cent Error suggests that our ageing method represents a non-biased and precise approach to the age assessment. Marginal increments were significantly different between months (Kruskal\textendash{}Wallis P = 0.017) with a distinct trend of increasing monthly increment growth beginning in January. When compared to previously published studies, our growth estimates suggest slower growth than populations in the Pacific Ocean but faster growth than previously reported in the Gulf of Mexico.},

A significant linear relationship (r2 = 0.91) was found between the vertebrae radius and total length, suggesting isometric growth of vertebrae with total length. Distinct bands of heavier calcification were visualized with silver nitrate staining. The periodicity of these growth marks was determined by the frequency of clear and dark margins of the vertebrae in each month of the year. We found that one growth mark is deposited annually. Estimated ages ranged from 0 to 18 years, with the majority of fish being 1\textendash{}5 years old. Age and TL were used to describe the shortfin mako growth. Estimates of the von Bertalanffy curve parameters for the combined sexes were: L$\infty$ = 411 cm TL, k = 0.05 year-1, t0 = -4.7 years. Our results suggest that shortfin makos are relatively slow growing sharks, which combined with other life-history traits such as a low fecundity and delayed reproduction, makes this species highly susceptible to overfishing.},

Two growth models were fitted to observed data: the von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM) with t0 as the third parameter and a modified version of the VBGM using a fixed size-at-birth intercept as the third parameter. To address the variability in size-at-birth, a Monte Carlo simulation was incorporated into the size-at-birth intercept. The sex-specific growth models were not significantly different, allowing a sexes combined model to be generated. The traditional VBGM predicted a theoretical maximum size (L$\infty$) of 3007$\cdot$1 mm LF, a growth coefficient (K) of 0$\cdot$042 year-1 and a theoretical age at zero length (t0) of \textendash{}6$\cdot$844 years. The modified VBGM with a fixed size-at-birth intercept of 565 mm LF predicted an L$\infty$ of 2289$\cdot$2 mm LF and a K value of 0$\cdot$089 year-1. When comparing model estimates to previously published information, the traditional VBGM predicted a significantly lower theoretical maximum size and a higher growth coefficient than those produced using data collected during the 1980s. Overall, results obtained using the VBGM with a fixed size-at-birth produced more biologically realistic parameters than that of the VBGM with t0. The Monte-Carlo simulation incorporating variability in size-at-birth produced similar results to the VBGM using a fixed size-at-birth. This study provides the first attempt to incorporate variability at size-at-birth and provide measurements of variability around the individual parameter estimates for an elasmobranch.},

Growth characteristics of the central mudminnow (Umbra limi) have not yet been accurately described using reliable hard part analysis. The utility of scales and otoliths as ageing structures and quantified growth was examined in one lake and one stream population of central mudminnow. Scales were found to be of no utility in determining age due to inconsistent formation of yearly annuli and a high incidence of regenerated scales, while otoliths were easily extracted and considered to be an accurate ageing structure. Ages determined from scales were low compared to those from otoliths, and the difference in age interpreted from the two structures increased with fish age. A power function was fitted to describe the length-weight relationship for this species (a = 0.0069, b = 3.175). Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated and compared for each population (Lake: L$\infty$ = 114.20 mm, K = 0.30, t0 = -0.93; Stream: L$\infty$ = 77.59 mm, K = 0.63, t0 = -0.76). The lake population showed greater size at age compared to the stream population, especially at older ages, and achieved a larger maximum size. Growth rate was also greater in the lake population (Lake: 1.74; Stream: 1.09 g year-1). Females were larger at age than males in both populations, however all individuals greater than age 3 were males. This work represents the first successful account of central mudminnow growth using hard part analysis.},

This situation is redressed here by investigating aspects of the reproduction, age and growth of estuarine populations of S. maculata in south-eastern Australia. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) values indicated peak spawning occurred between September and February and that the estimated mean fork length at maturity (L50) was 14.6 cm for males and 15.2 cm for females. Females displayed an asynchronous pattern of oocyte development, with individuals probably spawning multiple times in a spawning season. A validated aging protocol using thin sectioned otoliths was used to estimate the age of fish. The maximum ages for males and females were 9.5 and 12.0 years, respectively. Growth differed between sexes, with males (L$\infty$ = 24.04, K = 0.70, t0 = -0.09) attaining a smaller maximum length than females (L$\infty$ = 25.01, K = 0.72, t0 = -0.04). The age composition of gill-net and beach-seine samples mainly consisted of individuals aged 2\textendash{}4 years, and there was evidence of variable recruitment.

Studies about the fishes potential impacts on resident species promote the need for an increasing knowledge of their basic stock structures such as growth rates, longevity and mortality, which all rely on accurate estimates of age. Former studies on the round goby have used several different age reading techniques. In this study, we compared three standard otolith preparation methods for ageing and present the best procedure for the invasive round goby. The results showed significant differences in age estimates of the same fish between the different preparation methods and between readers. The estimation of the first annulus, the first year, was the most problematic. The overall agreement was lowest when reading the whole otoliths while the best performance was achieved with sectioned and stained preparation method. Depending on method used the growth estimates also differed. The results question comparability between previous studies and highlight the importance of harmonised aging procedures for the round goby for obtaining correct estimates of population parameters such as growth rate, age at maturity, and longevity.},

Age was estimated via scale and whole otolith reading methods. Total length (n = 413) ranged from 103 to 432 mm, and weight from 12 to 1042 g. Significant differences between the length-weight relationships of males and females were detected (P $<$ 0.05). Isometric growth was observed in juveniles and males, whereas total population and females exhibited positive allometric growth. The marking pattern in scales and otoliths followed an annual rhythm, with the formation of only one annulus in scales and only one hyaline band in otoliths during autumn-winter. The oldest males were 5 years old whereas maximum age in females was 12 years from scales and 15 years from otoliths. Because scales were found to underestimate age in individuals older than 4 years, otoliths were considered to be the best structures for creole perch age determination. Gompertz growth parameters based on otolith data were L$\infty$: 428.0 mm, k = 0.46 and t0 = 0.43 for total population (r = 0.90), L$\infty$: 410.7 mm, k = 0.42 and t0 = 0.46 for males (r = 0.91), and L$\infty$: 434.1 mm, and k = 0.49 and t0 = 0.43 for females (r = 0.91). Lengths at first maturity (TL50) were 260 and 241 mm in males and females, respectively, both of which corresponded to ages between 1 and 2 years. Macroscopic gonad inspection and the high percentage of juveniles captured during summer indicated that spawning begins at the end of spring.},

The study was conducted across the species' distribution that encompasses two state jurisdictions (Queensland in the north and New South Wales in the south) using data collected approximately 10 years apart in each state. Estimates of age were made by counting annuli (validated using marginal increment ratios) in sectioned sagittal otoliths. The maximum estimated age was 19 years. Pearl perch attained approx. 12 cm fork length (FL) after one year, 21 cm FL after 2 years and 29 cm FL after 3 years. Fish from the southern end of the species' distribution grew significantly more slowly than those from the northern part of its range. Commercial landings in the north were characterized by greater proportions of larger ($>$40 cm FL) and older ($>$6 years) fish than those in the south, with landings mainly of fish between 3 and 6 years of age. The observed variations in age-based demographics of pearl perch highlight the need for a better understanding of patterns of movement and reproduction in developing a model of population dynamics and life-history for this important species. There is a clear need for further, concurrent, age-based studies on pearl perch in the northern and southern parts of its distribution to support the conclusions of the present study based on data collected a decade apart.},

Counts were made of opaque growth increments and a readability score was assigned to each structure. Comparisons of growth increment counts were made between structures and between readings. All three structures showed some degree of readability and quantifiable growth increments, but this varied within fishes and between structures. Initial results showed that whole otoliths were more suitable to determine age estimates than dorsal spines and scales. Scales were considered unsuitable due to between reading ageing bias, variation in age estimates between structures, low precision and poor readability for this species. Dorsal spines showed evidence of loss of growth increments due to hollowing of the vascular core, which resulted in underestimation of older individuals in comparison to whole otoliths. Further analysis showed that growth increment counts from whole otoliths were lower for older individuals in comparison to sectioned otoliths. It is suggested that this is because of decreased clarity of growth increments towards the outer margin of whole otoliths in older individuals; this problem was not present with sectioned otoliths. It was concluded that sectioned otoliths were a more suitable structure from which to estimate age of L. argus than were whole otoliths, dorsal spines and/or scales.},

Although successful spawning and hatch of embryos has been verified, long-term catch records suggest that recruitment has not occurred for several decades as the extant stock lacks juvenile size classes and is comprised exclusively of large, presumably old individuals. Ages of 11 deceased (death years 1997\textendash{}2007) wild S. albus (136\textendash{}166 cm fork length) were estimated based on pectoral fin spines, sagittal otoliths and bomb radiocarbon (14C) assays of otoliths to test the hypothesis that members of this stock are old and to provide inferences on recruitment years that produced the extant stock. Age estimations based on counts of presumed annuli were about 2 years greater for otoliths (mean = 51 years, range = 43\textendash{}57 years) than spines (mean = 49 years, range = 37\textendash{}59 years). Based on 14C assays, confirmed birth years for all individuals occurred prior to 1957, thus establishing known longevity of at least 50 years. Estimated age based on presumed otolith annuli for one S. albus was validated to at least age 49. Although 14C assays confirmed pre-1957 birth years for all S. albus, only 56\% of estimated ages from spines and 91\% of estimated ages from otoliths depicted pre-1957 birth years. Both ageing structures were subject to under-ageing error (up to 15 years). Lack of or severe curtailment of S. albus recruitment in the upper Missouri River basin since the mid-1950s closely parallels the 1953\textendash{}1957 timeframe when a mainstem reservoir was constructed and started to fill. This reservoir may function as a system-wide stressor to diminish recruitment success of S. albus in the upper Missouri River basin.},

Little is known regarding the Grasse River population of lake sturgeon except that it is one of a few populations in New York State where spawning has been documented. Thus our purpose was to assess the current status of lake sturgeon in the Grasse River system, including age, growth, mortality, and abundance. Age was determined for 196 of 211 lake sturgeon by examination of sectioned pectoral fin rays. Ages ranged from 0 to 32 years and the annual mortality rate for fish between ages 7 and 14 was 16.8\%. The weight (W, g) to total length (TL, mm) relationship was W = 1.281 \texttimes{} 10-6TL3.202. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was TL = 1913(1-e-0.0294(t+9.5691)). While the range of observed ages was similar to that of nearby St. Lawrence River populations, mean weight at age for an individual at 1000 mm TL was lower than that observed for lake sturgeon within Lake St. Francis of the St. Lawrence River. Predicted growth based on von Bertalanffy parameters was similar to that observed for the nearby Lake St. Francis. An open population estimator using the POPAN sub-module in the Program MARK produced an abundance estimate of 793 lake sturgeon (95\% CI = 337\textendash{}1249).},

  abstract = {The aim of this work was to compare age determinations and precision using two deposition structures of trahira Hoplias malabaricus (Bloch, 1794): the scales, which are most frequently used, and otoliths (lapilli). The length-age relationships were obtained with both structures and compared with results from previous studies. The 163 sets of trahira otoliths (lapilli) and scales were 17\textendash{}46 cm standard length (SL) from Cayast\'a (Santa Fe) and Islas Lechiguanas (Entre R\'ios), Paran\'a River, Argentina. Three independent readings of each structure were conducted. An age bias plot was performed to compare age estimations from scales and otoliths. To assess the precision of age determinations using both structures, the percent agreement among readers for both structures and the coefficient of variation were calculated (\%CV). The age-length relationships were plotted and fitted with the von Bertalanffy growth function for both structures and compared with previous works. Age readings recorded for scales were lower than those recorded for otoliths for ages above or equal to 3 years. Percent agreement among readers was higher than 80\% for otoliths and less than 65\% for scales. The\%CV obtained for scales was 20\% for young fish and 17\% for adults. For otoliths the \%CV was 7\% for young fish and 3\% for adults. The \%CV obtained for scales was over the recommended limit ($>$7.6\%). The von Bertalanffy parameters for scales were Linf = 45.80 mm; k = 0.29; t0 = -1.34 and for otoliths were Linf = 40.76 mm; k = 0.39; t0 = -1.05. Precision of age estimations assessed from the percent agreement and the coefficient of variation indicates that the scales of the trahira are inappropriate to estimate age in population studies for juvenile and adult specimens.},

  abstract = {The sharpbelly Hemiculter leucisculus, an invasive species, has expanded its range throughout much of Asia and into the Middle East. However, little is known of its adaptive changes regarding life history traits such as age, growth and mortality that could possibly explain its success as an invasive species. A detailed study of the invasive sharpbelly was conducted based on 4539 samples collected from July 2009 to June 2011 in Erhai Lake, China. Standard length ranged from 4.3\textendash{}19.1 cm for females and 4.6\textendash{}12.3 cm for males. Length\textendash{}weight relationships for females and males were significantly different and described as W = 0.0076SL3.2608 and W = 0.0084SL3.1901, respectively. Otoliths are ideal for age determination because of the single annulus formed each year. Based on marginal increment analysis, the total mean CV for age estimate between two readings was 3.55\%. The von Bertalanffy growth curves computed by observed length-at-age data were expressed as Lt = 25.6 (1 - e-0.176 (t + 1.347)) for females and Lt = 16.4 (1 - e-0.354 (t + 0.819)) for males. According to the age, growth and mortality data, there are three possible reasons for H. leucisculus attaining such dominance within a short time in Erhai Lake. First, because of the simple age structure of this species: 97.58\% of males were 1\textendash{}2 years old with a maximum age of only 3 years; 93.14\% of females were 1\textendash{}3 years old, with a maximum age of 6 years. Second, females grew larger than males at any age. Third, instantaneous mortality rates were much higher for males (4.22 year-1) than for females (1.17 year-1).},

Enhancement of growth bands is necessary to accurately and efficiently determine age. However, most traditional techniques do not describe an efficiency of a series of procedures and the detailed protocol for different-sized sharks. We describe a simple and highly successful technique for ageing vertebrae of blue shark (Prionace glauca) that we refer to as ``burn method'', derived from the ``break and burn method'' and ``shadowing method''\textemdash{}a simple procedure requiring an alkaline treatment to clean the vertebral centra and a burning treatment to enhance growth band visualization. We described optimal times for sharks of precaudal length of 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm as 44.9, 88.7, 134.0, 183.5 s of alkaline treatment, and 6.8, 8.9, 10.2, and 11.5 min of burning treatment; both longer and shorter exposure times resulted in higher failed sample frequencies. Using our burn method, it is possible to do ageing a sample from a wide angle, with the reader able to obtain information on growth bands from different perspectives. To critique different technique efficiencies, the index of average percent error (IAPE) and mean coefficient of variation (CV) are compared for independent readers using the burn method and other techniques (silver nitrate impregnation and the unstained shadowing methods). The precision of the burn method (IAPE, 4.1\%; CV, 5.7\%) was similar to that of silver nitrate impregnation (IAPE, 5.8\%; CV, 8.2\%) and unstained shadowing method (IAPE, 8.3\%; CV, 11.8\%). For younger specimens, the IAPE and CV of the burn method were lower than those of the other techniques, but, compared with other ageing methods, precision decreased for older sharks. We demonstrate that the burn method to be accurate for age determination of blue sharks, especially for specimens with less than 10 bands, but recommend simultaneous use of other methods, such as thin sectioning (the most common for structure-based ageing) and bomb carbon dating, to accurately determine the age of older individuals.},

All tetracycline-treated otoliths were 1 year of age and revealed a clear fluorescent mark when observed under UV light. Otolith weight increased exponentially with standard length, and linearly with age, indicating that otolith growth continues with age and is independent of size. Age of fish in the sample ranged from 1 to 27 years. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was TLt = 36.33 (1 - e-0.12 (t + 0)). Total rate mortality (Z) was estimated to be 0.10. Attaining maximal size slowly, P. paru has a long life expectancy. Most linear growth is achieved within approximately 74\% of the lifetime of the fish. Besides being an important ornamental species, P. paru has been commonly captured for decades as bycatch in trap fisheries. These growth parameters should be used with the purpose of managing fisheries targeting this species before more meaningful limits can be imposed. In the aquarium trade management, it is suggested that conservationist issues should be based on capture-per-area and the establishment of protected areas.},

The relatively low value of total mortality (Z = 0.90) and relatively high value of constant rate of natural mortality (M = 0.64) was estimated. Presumed calculated fishing mortality (F = 0.26) and the consequently estimated exploitation ratio (E = 0.29) indicated no danger of an over-exploitation of this species in the study area at the current level of fishing pressure. The low T max and correspondingly high M suggest that this small benthic predator plays an important role in the Adriatic ecosystem as a prey species for large benthic predators. However, the estimates include uncertainties and require further confirmation, especially with regard to natural mortality.},

The overall sex ratio was 1.22 : 1 in favour of males. Total mortality, corresponding to the slope of the descending limb of the catch curve, was Z = 0.81 per year for females and Z = 0.85 per year for males.

  abstract = {Age, growth, and reproductive characteristics of blackspot snapper Lutjanus fulviflammus around the Yaeyama Islands (24$^\circ$N, 124$^\circ$E) in southern Japan were investigated between 2010 and 2014. Samples were caught by angling or purchased monthly at fish markets to cover all size ranges and seasons. Specimens consisted of 280 females (176\textendash{}347 mm fork length), 177 males (193\textendash{}325 mm), and 17 juveniles (42\textendash{}128 mm). Spawning was confirmed from April to August by the presence of postovulatory follicles, which, based on the occurrence of yolked oocytes possibly also occurred in March and September. Maximum fork length and age in the specimens around Yaeyama Islands were 347 mm and 23 years for females and 325 mm and 21 years for males. These results were compared to those reported previously for the species in other regions by standardized criteria. Possible spawning duration of 7 months in the population around Yaeyama Islands is similar to that in New Caledonia (22$^\circ$S, 5 months) and Okinawa Island (26$^\circ$N, 6 months), but shorter than that in Tanzania (8$^\circ$S) and the southern Arabian Gulf (25$^\circ$N) ( 12 months). The maximum body sizes and ages around Yaeyama Islands are also similar to the populations in New Caledonia and Okinawa Island ($>$300 mm FL, $>$20 years old), but larger/older than those in Tanzania and the southern Arabian Gulf ($<$300 mm FL, $<$20 years old). These differences are thought to reflect water temperature, i.e. spawning duration is shorter in lower temperature regions (annual mean $<$26$^\circ$C, New Caledonia, Okinawa Island, Yaeyama Islands) than in higher temperature regions (annual mean $>$27$^\circ$C, Tanzania, southern Arabian Gulf). Subsequently, a shorter spawning duration extends the life-span as well as the maximum body size. Longevity of blackspot snapper is thought to be negatively correlated with the duration of the spawning season.},

  abstract = {The cutlassfish is one of the most commercially important continental fishes in the East China Sea. However, the current classification of cutlassfishes is suboptimal and complicates fisheries management. This study investigated the growth and reproduction of three cutlassfish species in the southern East China Sea. Between August 2002 and September 2003, a total of 2717 specimens of Trichiurus japonicus, T. sp.2 (likely synonymous for T. nanhaiensis) and T. lepturus were collected monthly from Daxi, Anping, Nanfangao, Donggang and Xingang fishing ports. The von Bertalanffy growth model in preanal length (PL) resulted in PL (mm) for T. japonicus, PL(mm) for T. sp.2 and PL (mm) for T. lepturus. Their growths were significantly different between sexes for T. japonicus and T. sp.2 and among the three species. From macroscopic examination of ovaries, histological inspection of oocytes, and analyses of gonosomatic and hepatosomatic indices, T. japonicus was likely to spawn all year round, with two peaks in February\textendash{}July and November\textendash{}December. T. sp.2 spawned relatively later, between April and August. The length at sexual maturity of T. japonicus females was 264 mm PL or 746 mm total length. The sex ratios of T. japonicus and T. sp.2 were significantly different from 1 : 1 whereas T. lepturus showed no significant difference. The three species of trichiurids have different geographical distributions in this region.},

The study also aimed to present a qualitative comparison of latitudinal variations in some of these characteristics along the eastern Australian coastline. The sampled population contained fish aged up to 10 years with a maximum size of 39.2 cm fork length (LF), and was dominated by 1\textendash{}5 year olds. Sexual divergence in both the age and size structure of the population was recorded. Female S. ciliata grew slightly faster and attained a greater maximum size (L$\infty$ = 33.79 cm LF, k = 0.50 year-1 and t0 = -0.57 years) than males (L$\infty$ = 29.73 cm LF, k = 0.49 year-1 and t0 = -0.67 years). Females also matured at a significantly larger size (19.13 cm) and older age (1.63 years) than males (size: 17.07 cm, age: 1.10 years). Reproductive activity was highest between September and March. There were no differences between males and females in terms of mortality rate; the estimated total population, natural and fishing mortality rates were Z = 0.64, M = 0.42 and F = 0.22, respectively. Although these mortality rates suggest that S. ciliata in the Clarence River are relatively resilient to current rates of exploitation, regular monitoring of their commercial and recreational catch as well as their population structure is recommended in order to maintain sustainable fisheries. Potential latitudinal shifts in the spawning period, age structure and growth of S. ciliata along eastern Australia were also revealed.},

Previous studies have shown that increased harvest pressure in this species can affect the age-at-maturation and result in recruitment overfishing. Therefore, it is important to closely and continuously monitor commercially exploited populations. Over the past decade (2007\textendash{}2016), 13,170 shovelnose sturgeon were sampled with boat electroshocking, hoop nets, drift nets, trotlines, and benthic electrified trawls. Captured fish ranged from 61 to 910 mm fork length (FL; mean = 668 mm), with very few fish less than 550 mm FL. Although fish were found to be in a healthy condition (mean relative weight = 87), there was a decrease in the mean condition over time. In addition, we saw declines in mean FL, weight of roe-per-fish, and size-at-maturity for female fish directly impacted by harvest. The decline of these population parameters, coupled with an increase in total annual mortality and a truncated age frequency distribution, suggest that harvest is negatively impacting the demographics and recruitment of shovelnose sturgeon in the Wabash River. Considering the downward trajectory of population dynamics and high estimates of mortality, their resiliency to continued harvest and environmental changes will be limited.},

  abstract = {Between 1992 and 2000, 681 blue sharks, Prionace glauca (173.8\textendash{}310cm total length, TL) were collected off northeastern Brazil (Brazilian EEZ). Vertebral sections of 156 males (173.8\textendash{}310cm TL) and 80 females (185.5\textendash{}283cm TL) were analysed. The index of average percentage error (IAPE) ranged from 0 to 3.1\% for 3\textendash{}12 growth rings (GRs). Mean marginal increment (MI) decreased from November to January without, however, conclusively confirm the annual pattern of deposition. Growth parameters were derived using the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF), the Richards function and the Schnute function. VBGF was that which best fit the data. Parameters derived from back-calculated lengths, K=0.157, L$\infty$=352.1cm and t0=-1.01 year, were considered to best describe growth. First maturity sizes of 225cm for males and 228cm for females corresponded to 5-GRs individuals. A 310-cm male had 12GRs which was the highest number in the entire sample. Growth rates of 33.9cm per GR were estimated from birth to the first band corresponding to 60.2\% of size at birth, which is 56.4cm. Adult males were 90.5\% of the entire male sample and, adult females corresponded to 79.6\% of the sample of females. The male sample was composed of individuals from 3 to $>$11GRs and females were 3 to 10GRs. Males were larger (with higher number of GRs) and outnumbered females in the overall sample, as commonly occurs in catches worldwide. Despite the hypothesis of differential growth by sex, postulated by several authors, the present study demonstrated that growth curves did not differ significantly, even considering significant vertebral radius (VR)\textendash{}TL regressions for males and females. Higher growth rates were found in the southern Hemisphere, leading to significant differences in VBGF when compared to other areas. Discards and unreported catches are of great concern for conservation of this important apex predator.},

Although marginal increment (MI) analysis suggests that band formation occurs in the third and fourth trimesters in juveniles, it was inconclusive for adults. Thus, it was assumed that one band
is formed annually. Births that occur over a protracted period may be the most important source of bias in MI
analysis. An estimated average percent error of 2.4\% was found in readings for individuals between two and seventeen
years. The von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) showed no significant differences between sexes, and the model derived from back-calculated mean length at age best represented growth for the species (L$\infty$=270 cm, K=0.11/yr, t0=\textendash{}2.71 yr) when compared to the observed mean lengths at age and the Fabens' method. Length-frequency analysis on 1055 specimens (93\textendash{}260 cm) was used to verify age determination.

200\textendash{}205 cm (age ten) for females. Age composition, estimated from an age-length key, indicated that juveniles
predominate in commercial catches, representing 74.3\% of the catch. A growth rate of 25.4 cm/yr was estimated
from birth to the first band (i.e. juveniles grow 38\% of their birth length during the first year), and a growth rate

The Bowker test of symmetry and the Index of Average Percent Error, suggest that this ageing method represents an unbiased and precise age assessment. Results show that immediately after birth (in summer), the first OB was formed and in the next winter showed the second OB. Later it was observed that two OBs were formed each year, one during summer and the other during winter, influenced by the sea surface temperature (SST). Based on the comparison of five back-calculation methods, the best methods were FraserLee.

Annual periodicity was verified by marginal increment ratio (MIR) analysis in otoliths and edge analysis in vertebrae and opercular bones. Annuli formed, once a year, between March and May for all three bony structures. Otoliths, vertebrae and opercular bones were examined to determine which structure produced the most precise and accurate age estimates in S. o'connori. Vertebrae and otoliths matched closely for the first 21 years of life, while opercular bones appeared to underestimate age. For older fish, the counts diverged and otoliths consistently providing higher age estimates. Sectioned otoliths proved to be the most precise and accurate structure for age estimation.

Is there any evidence of spatial stratification in population age structure or growth? Fish were sampled in the Paran\'a, Ivinhema and Baia Rivers and in the Itaipu reservoir from 2012 to 2013.

Relative marginal distance analyses indicated that growth marks were annuli and formed in December\textendash{}January. Lost River suckers from the historic collection were aged to 57 years, while Lost River and shortnose suckers from the recent collection were aged to 40 years and 24 years, respectively. Larger and older Lost River suckers were represented in the historic collection compared to the recent collection. Uncoupling of otolith length and fish length in Lost River suckers as well as a large spread in the predicted age- at-size for shortnose suckers precluded the ability to back-calculate size-at-age. Likelihood ratio tests indicated the growth model parameters were significantly different at both the sex and collection level. Growth in body length for both species appeared determinate in that growth was rapid until maturity, and then slowed over several years until growth in length was nearly nonexistent; a 650\textendash{}700 mm Lost River sucker could be between 14 and 57 years old, while a 460 mm shortnose sucker could range from 12\textendash{}24 years old. In contrast, while growth in body length slowed for both species, body mass continued to increase. This growth strategy, which is also found in other western lake suckers, may allow for more energy to be utilized for reproduction and help populations persist in spite of years of limited recruitment or recruitment failure.},

The commercial and recreational fisheries targeting Nelusetta ayraudi have expanded substantially along the coast of New South Wales (NSW) in recent years but there exists little biological information on which to base effective management of this growing fishery. World-wide, only a few studies have aged monacanthids. Of these, researchers have interpreted periodic increments in bony structures such as vertebrae and anterior dorsal spines in preference to those found in otoliths. In this study we estimated age of N. ayraudi by counting growth increments in sectioned otoliths. The periodicity of increment formation was validated using a vital stain, (oxy-tetracycline), injected into young-of-the-year fish. Growth was rapid especially as juveniles with N. ayraudi attaining approximately 220 mm after 1 year and 340 mm after 2 years. No differences in growth rates were detected between sexes or between fish captured at different latitudes (zones). The largest male (605 mm, Total Length\textemdash{}TL) and female (656 mm, TL) were both recorded from northern NSW, with both sexes attaining the maximum age of 6+ years from northern and southern NSW. The von Bertalanffy parameters describing growth for N. ayraudi were L$\infty$L$\infty$ \{L\_$\backslash$infty \} = 591 mm (TL), k = 0.377 year-1 and to = -0.247 years.},

Significant differences between the sexes in size and age frequencies were found in all three species, with males being larger and older than females, or transitional individuals. These results strongly indicated that the population of these three grouper species showed monandric protogynous hermaphroditism. The sex ratios of E. polyphekadion and E. tauvina were biased in favor of females, but that of E. howlandi was equivalent between sexes. The relative sizes of ripe testes indicated that the intensity of sperm competition varied among species suggesting different mating system of each species. Reproductive seasonality was similar among species, with active vitellogenesis coinciding with the annual rise in water temperature. The active spawning period was determined to be between April and May for E polyphekadion, in May for E. howlandi, and from March to June for E. tauvina.},

Assuming an annual band formation, the preliminary assessment of the age suggests that M. japanica lives at least 14 years and has a low growth rate (K = 0.28 year-1). The minimum number of growth bands was one for spinetail devilrays with a 1,210\textendash{}1,390 mm DW, while the maximum was 14 for a 2,300 mm DW devilray. While age validation is still required, results indicate the feasibility of the use of caudal vertebrae for age estimation.

Age and growth characteristics of B. trachura, a poorly-known deepwater species, were determined from samples collected along the continental slope of the contiguous western United States. A new maximum size was established at 91.0 cm TL. Age was determined using a traditional structure (vertebral thin sections) with widespread application on multiple skate species and a non-lethal structure (caudal thorns) recently used for age analysis on skate species. Caudal thorns were determined not to be a useful ageing structure for this species based on poor precision and significantly lower age estimates when compared to age estimates from vertebral thin sections. The best model for describing growth of B. trachura was the two parameter VBGF, assuming annual vertebral band deposition and using length-at-age data. Although females grew slower and reached a larger maximum size than males, their growth was not statistically different (ARSS; P = 0.90); therefore, data were pooled (L$\infty$ = 99.38, k = 0.09). Annual band deposition was found to be a reasonable assumption for this species, but has yet to be validated. The maximum age estimated for B. trachura was 20 years for males and 17 years for females using vertebral thin sections.},

To increase our understanding of this potentially vulnerable species, and address the possibility of two separate populations in Alaskan waters, the age and growth of B. aleutica was studied. Vertebral centra were examined for age determination, and multiple growth models were evaluated to determine growth characteristics. Skates from the EBS attained maximum ages of 17 and 16 years for females and males, respectively, and the two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth functions generated estimates of k = 0.13 yr.-1 and L$\infty$ = 162.1 cm for females, with similar results for males. Skates from the GOA reached 19 years in females and 18 years in males. Growth parameters of female skates from the GOA were estimated as k = 0.11 yr.-1 and L$\infty$ = 160.0 cm, whereas males grew faster, with estimates of k = 0.15 yr.-1 and L$\infty$ = 138.2 cm. The results of this study may indicate the presence of distinct populations of B. aleutica in the eastern North Pacific.},

The present study investigated the age and growth of the Starry Skate, Raja stellulata, and compared it to other regional skates inhabiting the U.S. West Coast. Age and growth parameters were determined using two vertebral preparation techniques: gross sectioning and histological sectioning. Gross section age estimates ranged from zero to 11 years and growth was described by the two parameter von Bertalanffy growth function (2 VBGF; L $\infty$ = 915 mm total length (TL) and k = 0.13 year-1; n = 189). Histological section age estimates ranged from zero to 15 years and growth was also described by the 2 VBGF (L $\infty$ = 1092 mm TL, k = 0.06 year-1; n = 68). Histological section results reflect a more conservative life history, specifically a lower von Bertalanffy growth coefficient, but had slightly biased results and a smaller sample size than the gross section results. An age and depth trend was found within the central California skate assemblage, in which habitat depth and maximum age were positively correlated.},

A significant linear relationship was found between FL and vertebral radius for sexes combined. Marginal increment analyses were inconclusive about periodicity of growth band deposition and an annual periodicity was assumed to make age estimations. Specimens were estimated to be between 0 and 28 years of age. The Schnute model provided a good description of the individual growth for both sexes up to 15 years of age. Shortfin mako growth during the first year of life was 33.9 cm (ICr95\% = 19.9\textendash{}40.8) for females and 30.5 cm (ICr95\% = 25.6\textendash{}35.4) for males. Until approximately 15 years of age, both sexes showed similar growth and reached \textasciitilde{}217 cm FL. Sigmoid shaped growth curves obtained for both sexes indicated a change in the growth pattern close to 7 years of age. Inconclusive results about periodicity of growth band deposition in the study area make necessary the application of more robust validation techniques in the future. Meanwhile, a precautionary approach that assumes an annual deposition pattern in the western South Atlantic can be used for the assessment and management of stocks of this species, characterized by low fecundity and late maturity.},

Age estimated from vertebral band counts resulted in an Index of Average Percent Error (IAPE) of 5.6\%, suggesting that this method represents an accurate approach to the age assessment of L. ocellata. Size at sexual maturity was assessed by evaluating three endpoints: steroid hormone concentrations, and morphological and histological criteria. Our results suggest that 50\% maturity in males occurs at a total length of 730 mm and at 11 years of age. For females, our results suggest that 50\% maturity occurs at a total length of 760 mm and between 11 and 12 years of age. Collectively, our study suggests that analyzing a combination of reproductive parameters offers an accurate estimation of sexual maturity in the winter skate. Moreover, our results indicate that L. ocellata is a late-maturing and long-lived species, characteristics which make it highly susceptible to over-exploitation by commercial fisheries.},

The lower jaw-fork length and total weight of 572 specimens were measured, and the fourth dorsal spine was collected to determine age. The monthly variation of the sample size displayed a well-defined seasonal pattern, which peaked during the warm period (May\textendash{}November) and declined during the rest of the year (temperate period). Significant differences were detected in the size structure by sex during the temperate period, with females displaying larger sizes and greater abundance (Female:Male = 3.35:1). In the warm period the size structure was similar, with the sex ratio reaching F:M = 0.73:1. This suggests a different sex-related recruitment in the fishing zone, with males moving more actively than females. While female size remained relatively unchanged over the year, male size increased during the warm period. Age was estimated using the number of growth rings on the cross-sectioned fourth dorsal spine, after the number of absorbed growth rings in the vascularized zone had been estimated. Nine age groups were identified; group-5 was the most abundant, representing 31\% of the catch. The trend of the monthly change in the percentage of opaque-edge spines and the average of the marginal increase rate indicated that the formation of growth rings displayed an annual pattern. The von Bertalanffy growth model was adequately fitted to age and back-calculated length data. Significant differences were detected when growth was compared between sexes; females grew faster than males.},

  abstract = {We describe the microincrements, checks and annuli in the lapilli of the schizothoracine Ptychobarbus dipogon, an endemic species of the Tibetan plateau. We collected samples in the Yarlung Tsangpo River and its tributaries on a monthly basis (from April 2004 to August 2006). We describe the shape features of the three pairs of otoliths and document the full trajectory of lapillus development. We found that five to seven checks were clearly visible in the opaque zone of the first annulus. The pattern of 21\textendash{}23 daily growth increments within each check might be explained as a lunar-induced deposition. We counted between 137 and 154 increments within the first annulus. Annuli appeared as a sequence of gradually declining increment widths, whereas false rings were characterized by abrupt checks. Our oldest estimates were 23+years for males and 44+ for females. The time of annulus completion was clearly between March and April each year using monthly marginal increments analysis. We consider the factors responsible for daily increment formation as an endogenous circadian rhythm. Environmental information, such as strong sunlight and cold water temperatures in the Tibetan Plateau, could reinforce the endogenous daily cycle. Our results provided important data addressing the ecology and population dynamics of P. dipogon.},

Staining fishes with ALC indicated that opaque zones were formed during winter and spring, but did not become visible on the otolith edge until late spring and summer. Hyporhamphus australis were found to be similar to the hemiramphids of the Atlantic in having fast growth rates and a maximum observed age of 4+ years old. Hyporhamphus regularis ardelio and Arrhamphus sclerolepis krefftii were found to be more similar to the southern sea garfish, Hyporhamphus melanochir, in being moderately long-lived, with maximum observed ages of 7+ years old for both species. Females grew faster and attained greater fork lengths than males for each species. Sectioned otoliths showed large variation in the appearance of opaque zones between the three species studied, with those from the wide-ranging, oceanic H. australis appearing inconsistent and diffuse when compared to the estuarine H. r. ardelio and A. s. krefftii. This variation was also apparent from fishes kept in aquaria, suggesting that the appearance of opaque zones in otoliths of these species is largely influenced by physiology, rather than by environmental conditions.},

Nucleus vascularization seriously affected specimens older than 6 years, with the disappearance of 40\textendash{}50\% of the presumed annuli by that age. An alternate sectioning location was a clear improvement and this finding is an important contribution to the methodology of using this structure for ageing the full-length range of eastern T. thynnus.

Ring formation frequency was determined to be annual by using marginal increment analysis. The von Bertalanffy growth function parameters were estimated as: L$\infty$ = 43.7 cm LS; K =0.22 year; t0 = -1.59 years. Functional males are significantly younger than functional females, with sexually transitional individuals between the modal ages of males and females supporting protandry in this species. Males become sexually mature within 1 year and 50\% age at sex change is at 2 years. The maximum age recorded for both males and females sampled was 9 years which is lower than for conspecifics elsewhere and may reflect high fishing pressure in the study area when compared with conspecifics in other areas or could reflect latitudinal effects. Otolith mass was significantly and positively related to age, providing a cheap and quick alternative method for approximating age. Acanthopagrus schlegelii is a relatively fast-growing and rapidly maturing species attaining a similar asymptotic length to conspecifics. A need for fishery management is indicated to protect both young juveniles and older adults, especially females, to increase reproductive output and safeguard fishery production.},

The maximum recorded age was 17 years for L. argentea and 12 years for M. elongatus, which is greater than generally observed in other species of mugilids. Growth models of each species significantly differed between sexes and, except for male L. argentea, between estuaries. Fishes from Lake Macquarie generally had a greater mean LF at age than those from St Georges Basin and females of both species generally attained a greater maximum LF and age than males. Gillnet catches of L. argentea were of similar LF and age compositions in both estuaries, whereas the age composition of catches of M. elongatus in Lake Macquarie contained a greater proportion of younger fish. Estimates of total, natural and fishing mortality were greater for M. elongatus than L. argentea across both estuaries, and estimates of total mortality were greatest for both species in Lake Macquarie.

Age was estimated from dorsal-spine sections of 4687 individuals sampled from U.S. waters during 2003\textendash{}2013, including both fishery-independent (n = 1312) and fishery-dependent (n = 3375) samples. Ninety-six per cent (n = 4498) of these sections were deemed suitable for ageing; average per cent error between two independent readers was 10$\cdot$8\%. Fork length (LF) ranged from 65 to 697 mm and age estimates from 0 to 14 years. Both sex and sample source (fishery-independent v. recreational) significantly affected estimated size at age for 2\textendash{}6 year-old fish. Data were pooled between sources to fit sex-specific von Bertalanffy growth functions. Results for the female model were L$\infty$ = 387 mm LF, k = 0$\cdot$52 year-1 and t0 = 0$\cdot$01 year, while for males L$\infty$ = 405 mm LF, k = 0$\cdot$55 year-1 and t0 = 0$\cdot$02 year. These results were significantly different between sexes and indicate clear sexual dimorphism. Thus, growth should be modelled separately by sex when examining population parameters or conducting stock assessment modelling. The positive bias in estimates of size at age computed for recreational v. fishery-independent samples also has clear implications for stock assessment as growth functions computed with fishery-dependent samples would tend to overestimate stock productivity.},

Growth increment formation on these otoliths was validated as annual using edge analysis and the mark-recapture of chemically tagged captive fish. Resultant analysis showed that the species is slow growing and the oldest aged fish was a 17 year, 690 mm fork length (LF) male. The smallest ripe female fish measured 394 mm LF and was 7+ years old and the smallest mature male was 337 mm LF and 5+ years old. Slow growth and late maturity make this species vulnerable to exploitation emphasizing the need for continued high conservation priority.},

  abstract = {Between 2003 and 2005, vertebrae of 151 Xingu River Potamotrygon leopoldi (Potamotrygonidae) (75 males and 76 females) were analysed to derive a growth curve for this species. The disc width (WD) was significantly different between sexes, with females measuring 149\textendash{}700 mm WD and males 109\textendash{}500 mm WD. The average percentage error for vertebrae readings of the whole sample was 2$\cdot$7\%. The marginal increment ratio (RMI) showed an increasing trend with the highest value in November, decreasing from December on. The majority of vertebrae displaying RMI zero, occurred in September, but the annual periodicity of ring deposition throughout the year was not conclusive. Tetracycline (TCN) injected specimens were held in captivity for 13 months and displayed a fluorescent mark in vertebrae confirming a yearly periodicity of band pair formation with the translucent ring deposited in September\textendash{}October. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) showed that, among the seven models considered, the best fit was obtained for the von Bertalanffy modified with W0 (where W0 = WD at birth) for both sexes. Growth parameters for females were: W0 = 149 mm; W$\infty$ = 763$\cdot$06 mm; k = 0$\cdot$12 year\textendash{} 1, whereas for males: W0 = 109 mm; W$\infty$ = 536$\cdot$4 and k = 0$\cdot$22 year-1. Maximal ages were 7$\cdot$2 years in males and 14$\cdot$3 years in females. The species shows sexual dimorphism expressed in the growth pattern, size at maturity, longevity and asymptotic sizes. Concern for sustainability is raised due to the construction of the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Power Plant (2015 and 2016) in the State of Par\'a causing changes to the habitat of this species, which is endemic to the Xingu River and two of its tributaries.},

Growth zones in otoliths, with more than a few such zones, were readily detectable only after the otoliths had been sectioned. Visual analyses and modelling of the trends in marginal increments on sectioned otoliths demonstrate that these opaque zones are formed annually. Maximum ages of 55, 36 and 49 years, derived for P. recurvirostris, P. gallipavo and P. hutchinsi, respectively, reflect relatively low mortalities. These longevities greatly exceed those estimated, using otoliths, for Pentaceros wheeleri and Pentaceros richardsoni, which belong to the other pentacerotid subfamily. These differences may be due to the counts of `daily' growth zones in sectioned otoliths of P. wheeleri not representing the complete age range of that species and the zones detected in whole otoliths of P. richardsoni not constituting the complete range of annually-formed zones. Pentaceropsis recurvirostris, P. gallipavo and P. hutchinsi recruited into the fishery in the sampling area as 2\textendash{}3 year-old fishes. Pentaceropsis recurvirostris and P. hutchinsi exhibited little or no subsequent growth throughout the remainder of their protracted life, whereas, P. gallipavo continued to grow for c. 5 years and then underwent little further growth. Spawning of P. recurvirostris and P. hutchinsi peaked in the austral winter and autumn, respectively, but in the austral spring and summer with P. gallipavo, which is more typical of temperate species. Although the females of P. gallipavo and P. hutchinsi were mature, this did not apply to a few P. recurvirostris, some of which were $>$20 years old, implying that any given female of this species does not always spawn every year. Ovarian mass greatly exceeded testis mass, indicative of pair spawning, which is consistent with field observations. In contrast to P. recurvirostris and P. hutchinsi, the sex ratio was heavily biased towards males and the spawning period longer in P. gallipavo, suggesting that selection pressures for spawning success were greater for this latter species.},

Sampling was conducted throughout a year and included specimens to determine sex, maturity and age. Age was validated by the edge type and marginal-increment analysis. The oldest and the largest individuals were 9 years and 195 mm total length. Growth parameters fitted to the von Bertalanffy equation were L$\infty$ = 178$\cdot$34 mm, k = 0$\cdot$641 year-1 and t0 = -0$\cdot$341 years. Length and age at first maturity were 140$\cdot$72 mm and 2 years, respectively. The reproductive season was throughout the austral spring and summer. The assessment of the effects of fishing showed that it may have resulted in a loss of 50\% of the spawning potential. This loss may be higher when taking into account the uncertainty in the life-history parameters and could be considered of concern for the population. Fast growth, moderate longevity, long spawning season, small size and age at maturity make D. auriga relatively resilient to the removal of biomass by fishing. When considering the uncertainty, however, the losses of the spawning potential have been severely reducing the population resilience in the face of ecosystem changes.},

Three growth models were adjusted to the length at age and compared using Akaike's information criterion. The Gompertz growth model with estimated size at birth appeared to be the best and resulted in growth parameters of L$\infty$ = 139$\cdot$55 (LT) and K = 0$\cdot$17 year-1 for females and L$\infty$ = 126$\cdot$52 (LT) and K = 0$\cdot$18 year-1 for males. The largest female and male examined were 8 and 9 years old, but the majority was between 1 and 3 years old. Ages at maturity estimated were 5$\cdot$8 and 4$\cdot$8 years for females and males, respectively. These results suggest that R. acutus is a slow-growing species, which render the species particularly vulnerable to heavy fishery exploitation.

This species seems to have a long reproductive cycle, and even though no conclusive data were obtained, a 2\textendash{}3 year cycle is possible. The estimated coefficients indicate that this species has a vulnerable life cycle, typical of deepwater squalid sharks.

  abstract = {Key biological characteristics of the harlequin fish Othos dentex, a representative of a monospecific genus of the Anthiinae (Serranidae), were determined from samples collected around reefs on the south coast of Western Australia. The females of this relatively long-lived species (maximum recorded age in this study = 37 years) attained only a slightly greater maximum total length and age than males and neither the length nor the age-frequency distributions showed a conspicuous sex-based bimodality. Furthermore, gonads from a wide size and age range of O. dentex were shown by histology, at several locations along their length, to always comprise exclusively either ovarian or testicular tissues. Thus, O. dentex is a gonochorist, a sexual pattern only previously recorded definitively for one other anthiine serranid, i.e. Epinephelides armatus, which also occurs in south-western Australia. Similar to E. armatus, O. dentex possesses `solid' testes with a central sperm duct, thereby differing in structure from those typically found in serranids, in which there is a central membrane-bound `ovarian' lumen and peripherally located sperm sinuses. The gonadal characteristics and sexual pattern of these two gonochoristic anthiines are not consistent with a recent proposal for the trends exhibited by the evolution of gonochorism and protogyny within the Serranidae. Othos dentex has indeterminate fecundity and a protracted spawning period (7 months) and, on the basis of underwater observations and a low gonado-somatic index (IG) for males, is a pair spawner, which is unusual for a gonochorist of a serranid or member of a related family. While the large spots on the lower half of the body of O. dentex are shown quantitatively to be similarly yellow in juveniles and adult females, they then become blue in males at maturity and this intensifies during the spawning period, when they presumably play an important role in agonistic interactions among males and courtship with females. The attainment of maturity and rapid growth by O. dentex early in life may reflect selection pressures to reduce predation mortality during that period. Total mortality in the population is moderately low during later life, implying that the current fishing pressure on O. dentex is relatively light.},

Lifespan was not correlated with LF. Early growth for all species was rapid and similar during the first few years of life, but coefficients of the von Bertalanffy growth function varied considerably among species. Growth also differed between sexes for L. atkinsoni. Reproductive characteristics varied among species, with peak periods of spawning occurring in November to December for L. atkinsoni, July to August for L. nebulous, September to October for L. olivaceus and a protracted season for L. lentjan, although fewer samples were available for the last two species. Sex-specific LF and age distributions and gonad histology of L. lentjan were suggestive of a functional protogynous reproductive pattern, as observed in other lethrinids. Gonad histology indicated non-functional protogynous hermaphroditism for L. atkinsoni and L. nebulosus. The diversity of life histories among these closely related species emphasizes the difficulty in devising single management strategies appropriate for multi-species fisheries and illustrates the importance of understanding species-specific life histories to infer responses to exploitation.},

Two readers examined structures removed from 462 American shad, which were collected from the Merrimack River in Lawrence, Massachusetts, during May and June of 2008\textendash{}2010. The precision of age estimates were evaluated by comparisons of ages from different readers and structures. Age estimates determined from otoliths were the most precise (76.2\% agreement, 2.99\% coefficient of variation). Ages derived from scales were overestimated in young ($\leq$5 years) fish and underestimated in older ($\geq$7 years) fish, compared with ages determined from otoliths. Age estimates determined from vertebrae agreed with those obtained from otoliths better than ages from any other structure tested, but they were less precise and vertebrae required more processing than otoliths. Opercula were difficult to read, resulting in underestimation of the ages of fish that were age 5 and older. The results of this study indicate that the sagittal otolith is the most appropriate structure for determining the age of American shad.},

  abstract = {We compared five calcified structures (scale, otolith, vertebra, cleithrum, and opercular bone) for estimating the age of bream Abramis brama (L.) from the Irtysh River in China. Otoliths consistently had the clearest marks, highest confidence scores, highest between-reader agreement (91.63\%), and lowest CVs. Cleithra provided the second-highest between-reader agreement (88.65\%) and highest agreement (66.08\%) with otoliths. Scales and vertebrae yielded equivalent age estimates that were lower than those from otoliths and cleithra, but the estimates of A. brama older than 11 years were consistently underestimated using scales and vertebrae. Opercular bone was inferior to other structures for aging A. brama. Opercular bones resulted in the lowest between-reader agreement (84.68\%), lowest agreement with otoliths (62.33\%), and highest CVs. According to these findings, we recommend the use of ground otoliths for estimating the age of A. brama when an accurate age structure assessment is required, and recommend scales if a nonlethal procedure is needed for age estimation in order to analyze simple population metrics of A. brama.},

Ages determined from scales differed as much as four years from otoliths and opercles for fish older than age 6. Total length to structure radius relations were strongly correlated for scales and opercles. No significant differences were detected between mean back-calculated lengths determined from scales and opercles.

However, there is limited information on the relative precision of estimates from these two structures. Thus, we analyzed the precision of age estimates derived from otoliths and the articulating process of the pectoral spine and compared the dynamic processes (recruitment, growth, and mortality) resulting from those estimates. Aging structures were removed from 110 channel catfish captured from the Wabash River (river kilometers 550\textendash{}9.6) via day\textendash{}time electrofishing. The age estimation methodologies were similar to those described in previous studies. Agreement between the ages derived from the two structures was high; the average percent error was 8.4\%, the coefficient of variation was 11.4, and the slope of the age bias plots did not differ from 1, indicating similar age assignments between structures. The corresponding recruitment patterns, von Bertalanffy growth models, and mortality rates did not differ between the aging structures. We conclude that the articulating process of the pectoral spine provides age assignments similar to those of otoliths and that the dynamic processes do not differ between structures. Further, based on the results of this study, the articulating process of the pectoral spine provides a suitable alternative to otoliths and has the advantage that channel catfish do not have to be sacrificed.},

  abstract = {Dermal denticles are useful tools in taxonomic and phylogenetic studies focusing Chondrichthyes. In particular, Rajidae species can be differentiated, among other characteristics, by the number, disposition and morphology of these structures along the dorsal surface. Three types of dermal denticles can be defined: prickles, thorns and bucklers. The first ones are found all over the body, while, the remaining are present on restricted body locations. On a recent work, caudal thorns were successfully used for ageing rays and skates from Falkland Islands, but seemed inappropriate to age Atlantic species. The present paper analyses different types of denticles from the caudal region of Raja clavata, using specimens caught in Portuguese waters, with total length ranging from 13 to 89 cm. Denticles from each group were further analyzed for ageing purposes. The distance from the centrum origin to the distal edge of each growth band and the band width were measured. Following preestablished criteria on ageing reproducibility, thorns were selected and ages were assigned for each sampled specimen. Ageing precision was compared between thorns and vertebral centra. According to statistical measures thorns revealed to be more precise. Von Bertalanffy growth model was adjusted to age-at-length data: L$\infty$= 130.5 cm, k= 0.10 year-1 and t0= -0.14 year. Although females attain larger sizes than males, no statistical differences were observed on growth rates between sexes.},

The present study examined the life history of silky sharks (n=553) from Papua New Guinean waters. Age was analysed using sectioned vertebrae, and a multimodel approach was applied to the length-at-age data to fit growth models. Females ranged in length from 65.0- to 253.0-cm total length (TL), with the oldest estimated at 28 years. Males ranged in length from 68.4 to 271.3cm TL and were aged to a maximum of 23 years. The logistic model provided the best fitting growth parameter estimates of length at birth L0=82.7cm TL, growth coefficient g=0.14year\textendash{}1 and asymptotic length L$\infty$=261.3cm TL for the sexes combined. Females reached sexual maturity at 204cm TL and 14.0 years, whereas males reached maturity at 183cm TL and 11.6 years. The average litter size from 28 pregnant females was 8 (range of 3\textendash{}13). The growth parameters and late ages of sexual maturation for silky sharks in the central west Pacific suggest a significant risk from fisheries exploitation without careful population management.},

Understanding dynamic rate functions is critical for the effective management of sensitive burbot populations, which necessitates accurate and precise age estimates. Managing sensitive burbot populations requires an accurate and precise non-lethal alternative. In an effort to identify a non-lethal ageing structure, we compared the precision of age estimates obtained from otoliths, pectoral fin rays, dorsal fin rays and branchiostegal rays from 208 burbot collected from the Green River drainage, Wyoming. Additionally, we compared the accuracy of age estimates from pectoral fin rays, dorsal fin rays and branchiostegal rays to those of otoliths. Dorsal fin rays were immediately deemed a poor ageing structure and removed from further analysis. Age-bias plots of consensus ages derived from branchiostegal rays and pectoral fin rays were appreciably different from those obtained from otoliths. Exact agreement between readers and reader confidence was highest for otoliths and lowest for branchiostegal rays. Age-bias plots indicated that age estimates obtained from branchiostegal rays and pectoral fin rays were substantially different from age estimates obtained from otoliths. Our results indicate that otoliths provide the most precise age estimates for burbot.},

Understanding these differences is an important consideration in evaluating the sensitivity of these fishes to disturbance and in formulating effective conservation strategies, particularly when dealing with an assemblage consisting of multiple species within a watershed. We collected Apalachicola redhorse Moxostoma n. sp. cf. poecilurum (n = 125), spotted sucker Minytrema melanops (n = 94), and quillback Carpiodes cyprinus (n = 94) to determine age, growth, and reproductive biology of spawning catostomids in the Apalachicola River, Florida, during 2007. Quillback was the smallest in total length at age; longest-lived; most fecund; and produced the smallest eggs. Apalachicola redhorse was the largest in body size; had an intermediate life span; and produced the fewest yet largest eggs. Spotted sucker was more similar to Apalachicola redhorse in most characteristics. Growth during ages 1\textendash{}3 in all three species seemed to be negatively related to the proportion of observations of extreme flow, both high (Q90) and low (Q10), per year and a positive response in growth rate to high flows (.Q75 but , Q90). However, Apalachicola redhorse and spotted sucker growth was more sensitive to flow conditions than that of quillback. Our results suggest the life histories and ecological response of Apalachicola River catostomids to flow regulation are important components for developing strategies that incorporate the needs of these fishery resources into an ecosystem-based management approach.},

  abstract = {The life histories of small-bodied coastal sharks, particularly carcharhinids, are generally less conservative than those of large-bodied species. The present study investigated the life history of the small-bodied slit-eye shark, Loxodon macrorhinus, from subtropical Hervey Bay, Queensland, and compared this species' biology to that of other coastal carcharhinids. The best-fit age model provided parameters of LN \textonequarter{} 895 mm total length (TL), k \textonequarter{} 0.18 and t0 \textonequarter{} \`A6.3 for females, and LN \textonequarter{} 832 mm TL, k \textonequarter{} 0.44 and t0 \textonequarter{} \`A2.6 for males. For sex-combined data, a logistic function provided the best fit, with LN \textonequarter{} 842 mm TL, k \textonequarter{} 0.41 and a \textonequarter{} \`A2.2. Length and age at which 50\% of the population was mature was 680 mm TL and 1.4 years for females, and 733 mm TL and 1.9 years for males. Within Hervey Bay, L. macrorhinus exhibited an annual seasonal reproductive cycle, producing an average litter of 1.9 \AE{} 0.3 s.d. With the exception of the low fecundity and large size-at-birth relative to maximum maternal TL, the life-history traits of L. macrorhinus are comparable to other small-bodied coastal carcharhinids, and its apparent fast growth and early maturation contrasts that of large-bodied carcharhinids.},

  volume = {101},
  abstract = {Age and growth estimates for the winter skate (Leucoraja ocel$\-$ lata) were estimated from vertebral band counts on 209 fish ranging in size from 145 to 940 mm total length (TL). An index of average percent error (IAPE) of 5.8\% suggests that our aging method represents a precise approach to the age assessment of L. ocellata. Marginal increments were significantly different between months (KruskalWallis P$<$0.001) and a distinct trend of increasing monthly increment growth began in July. Estimates of von Berta$\-$ lanffy growth parameters suggest that females attain a slightly larger asymp$\-$ totic TL (L$\infty$=1374 mm) than males (L$\infty$=1218 mm) and grow more slowly (k=0.059 and 0.074, respectively). The oldest ages obtained for the winter skate were 19 years for males and 18 years for females, which corresponded to total lengths of 932 mm and 940 mm, respectively. The results indicate that the winter skate exhibits the charac$\-$ teristics that have made other elasmo$\-$ branch populations highly susceptible to exploitation by commercial fisheries.},

  abstract = {Salema, Sarpa salpa is a commercial exploited species in the Atlantic Ocean with little available information for the essential population parameters, such as age, growth and reproduction. The present study aims to describe these parameters for S. salpa obtained off the coast of Portugal. Ages were estimated from the whole otolith readings; the minimum and the maximum ages observed were 0 and 14 years, respectively, corresponding to 5.2 and 41.4 cm of total length (TL). Whole otolith readings and back-calculation approaches were used to estimate the parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function and the Akaike's information criterion value suggested that the second approach was the best one to describe the growth of salema: L
$\infty$ = 45.07 cm, k = 0.14 year-1 and t
0 = -1.43 year. The species is a protandric hermaphrodite and the sex change process occurred between 28.6 and 40.9 cm TL. A short spawning season was identified, extending from September to November. The estimated length at first maturity for males was 24.5 cm TL, corresponding to an age of 2 years at first maturity. This species exhibited a determinate fecundity type and the relative annual fecundity varied between 462 and 2662 oocytes per gram of gutted weight.},

  abstract = {The age, growth, and maturity of cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus) from California were studied from July 2000 \textendash{} July 2001. Ages were estimated using otoliths (n = 641) and validated using edge analysis. Errors in age estimates were calculated using average percent error, coefficient of variation, and index of precision. Growth was represented by the von Bertalanffy growth equation and statistically compared between sexes using Analysis of Residual Sum of Squares. Length and age at 50 \% maturity was modeled for both sexes using a logistic curve. Females attained a larger size and grew slower (L$\infty$ = 647.2 mm TL, k = 0.17) than males (L$\infty$ = 440.7 mm TL, k = 0.35). Growth appeared to be rapid through age 4 for males and age 6 for females. The oldest male was 13 years old; the oldest female, 14 years. Growth curves were statistically different between sexes (P $<$ .001). Length and age at maturity were estimated for males and females, with males maturing at 297 mm TL (1.9 yrs) and females at 337 mm TL (2.3 yrs).},

  abstract = {The yellow Irish lord Hemilepidotus jordani is an abundant, large sculpin found in the eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, where it is one of the most commonly caught sculpins. Interest in ecosystem-based fisheries management has increased, prompting the need to collect life history information from nontarget or incidental bycatch species. Sagittal otoliths were used to age 776 yellow Irish lords sampled during 2005 and 2006 in summer bottom trawl surveys conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center in the eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands regions. Annuli viewed on otolith surfaces and thin sections were enumerated to arrive at estimates of age. Specimens ranged from age 1 to a maximum of age 28, more than doubling the previously published estimate of longevity for this species. Age estimates from both regions were used to calculate separate sex-specific total mortality rates for yellow Irish lords based on catch-curve analysis. These new age estimates have resulted in potential changes in yellow Irish lord harvest recommendations, demonstrating the importance of age and growth information to fisheries managers.},

  abstract = {Scales and opercles were used to age yellow perch Perca flavescens collected in 1989 from Lake Madison (South Dakota), Dauphin Lake (Manitoba), and southern Lake Michigan (Indiana). Three readers aged fish from Lake Madison and Dauphin Lake once and two readers agedfishfrom Lake Michigan twice. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated to compare precision. Ages determined from opercles were as precise as those from scales for fish from Lake Madison (CV = 0 for both structures), and more precise than ages from scales for fish from Dauphin Lake (CV0 ercle = 14.0, CVscale = 27.4, P $<$ 0.001) and Lake Michigan (CVo ercle = 10.6, CVscale = 13.9, P $<$ 0.00/; The high precision of scale and opercle ages for yellow perch ftom Lake Madison can be attributed to the fast growth rate of fish from that lake and also that only age 1 and 2 fish were aged. The greater precision of opercle ages in comparison to scale ages for Dauphin Lake and Lake Michigan yellow perch can be attributed to ease of recognition of false annuli on opercles as well as to difficulty in distinguishing between false and true annuli crowded on the edge of scales from mature, slower growing fish. Because true annuli are more easily recognized on opercles, ages determined from opercles may be more accurate than ages determined from scales for yellow perch growing at slow or moderate rates.},

  abstract = {Previous ageing studies compared the precision of yellow perch (Perea flaveseens) scales to otoliths and scales to opercles and in each study, scales were proven to be less precise. To date, a comparative study between yellow perch otoliths and opercles has not been undertaken. Therefore, the goal of our study was to compare ageing precision of opercles to otoliths, while establishing the best methodology to use for ageing otoliths. Opercles and otoliths were collected from 217 yellow perch in the summer of2003 from three sites located in southern Lake Michigan. Opercles were read as whole structures, while otoliths were read whole, sectioned, and break and bum. All four methodologies were aged three times by three independent readers. Opercles, sectioned otoliths, and break and burn otoliths were found to be the most precise structures for aging. Further investigation into the ageing of yellow perch improves the efficiency and precision of the ageing process. As a result, better fisheries management practices can be utilized.},
