The impact that such a bias may have on the stock dynamics and the trends of the key population parameters, recruitment, spawning-stock biomass (SSB), and mortality are investigated. Assuming new growth parameters, a new age– length key is derived and used to produce and catch-at-age data and abundance indices, which are then used to assess the stock. Bias in estimating age affects the absolute levels of fishing mortality and stock biomass estimates, and also impacts the trend in SSB. However, trends in fishing mortality and recruitment are comparable, and the stock status with respect to precautionary reference points is broadly the same. As expected, the simulation also shows that the stock may be more reactive to changes in fishing levels, which affect medium-term forecasts. Longterm sustainable yields may also be impacted.},

Measures of both systematic difference (bias) and precision are required for this purpose, because measures of bias are not suitable as measures of precision, and vice versa. Using data from an age comparison study of haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus for demonstration purposes, we evaluated a variety of graphical and statistical approaches for making paired age comparisons from the standpoint of both detecting age differences and assessing precision. Parametric and nonparametric matched-pair tests, regression analysis, analysis of variance, and age difference plots were all capable of detecting systematic over- or underaging. However, only the age bias plot was sensitive to both linear and nonlinear biases. The coefficient of variation (CV = SD/mean) was a robust measure of precision, whereas the widely used percent agreement statistic was not. The combination of an age bias plot, an age frequency table, and a CV provides a powerful and easily prepared comparison of matched pairs of age determinations.},

The results indicated that FOS has the lowest sampling accuracy, POS performs the best and that ROS is a more efficient method with lower estimation error. For an imprecise reader, the centre (median) of multiple age reads is a useful method to obtain accurate and precise estimates. Ageing bias had greater effects on the estimation of age composition and growth parameters than ageing imprecision or the selection of otolith sampling methods. In most cases, 500 otoliths should be an adequate sample size and could be the guideline for the biological sampling program of the T. orientalis Catch Documentation Scheme.},

This review provides a critical overview of the methods used in previous fin spine ageing studies on billfishes and provides recommendations towards the development of a standardized protocol for estimating the age of striped marlin, Kajikia audax and white marlin, Kajikia albida. Three on-going fin spine ageing studies from Australia, Hawaii, and Florida are used to illustrate some of the considerations and difficulties encountered when developing an ageing protocol for highly migratory fish species. Particular areas of concern that may influence age and growth estimates included differences in fin spine selection, sectioning methods, criteria for identifying and measuring annuli, distinguishing false annuli, validation procedures, identification of the first annulus, and methods used to replace annuli lost due to vascularization of the fin spine core.},

The purpose of this programme is to assure, to the greatest extent possible, that ages used in stock assessment are based on consistent ageing criteria. This age data is entered into our AGEDATA Microsoft ACCESS™ database where it can be easily updated, corrected and analysed. VISUAL BASIC computer programmes AGREE (a precision estimating programme) and RANGES (an outlier searching programme) were written to routinely analyse age data before data are released to end-users. The statistical relationship between average percentage error and coefficient of variation is described, as well as an interpretation of Bowker's test for symmetry. Discrepancies between the reader and tester are reconciled while viewing the problematic otoliths using a dual-headed microscope, and reconciled ages are assigned.

	abstract = {The age data used to manage Walleye Sander vitreus fisheries are not always accurate, as otoliths typically provide more accurate age estimates for larger, older Walleyes than dorsal spines. We assessed the impacts that the aging error associated with the use of dorsal spines has on the estimated age distribution, growth and mortality rates, and yield per recruit for Walleyes in the Winnebago system, Wisconsin. Age distributions derived from otolith age estimates more accurately portrayed variable recruitment than those derived from dorsal spine age estimates. The mean estimates of instantaneous total annual mortality developed from sex-specific catch curves were greater when dorsal spine age estimates were used (0.515 for males, 0.493 for females) than when otolith age estimates were (0.349 for males, 0.396 for females), with most of the differences being observed in natural mortality estimates. The von Bertalanffy growth models were not significantly different, but the yield-per-recruit models (which rely heavily on von Bertalanffy model parameters) incorporating spine age data produced average yield estimates 50–70\% lower than the models developed from otolith ages. The yield-per-recruit models derived from spine-determined ages also resulted in lower recommendations as to the age and size of fish for maximum yield at all exploitation levels than the models developed from otolith age data. The mean dorsal spine and otolith age estimates were similar for male Walleyes {\textless}457 mm and female Walleyes {\textless}508 mm, but for larger fish otoliths yielded significantly older ages than spines. Given the economic and social impacts of the Winnebago system Walleye fishery, we recommend exclusive use of otoliths to obtain the most accurate estimates of fish age, growth, mortality, and yield. In populations in which the sacrifice of large quantities of fish is not acceptable, we recommend using spines to estimate the ages of smaller fish (males {\textless}457 mm, females {\textless}508 mm) and otoliths to estimate the ages of fish larger than these critical lengths.

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

Results indicate a great diversity in attention to, and no clear consensus on desirable standards for, quality issues, including staff training, use of reference sets, reading protocols, and post-reading analyses.

This error needs to be accounted for when conducting stock assessments. Common methods for quantifying age-reading error include the average percent error, the coefficient of variation, age bias plots, and age difference tables, but these techniques cannot be used to construct age-reading error matrices. A method for constructing age-reading error matrices that accounts for both ageing bias and ageing imprecision is outlined. Simulation evaluation of this method suggests that it is able to estimate both ageing bias (assuming that one reader is unbiased) and ageing imprecision for relatively large sample sizes and for the ages that constitute the bulk of the ages in the sample. However, the performance of the method is poor when sample sizes are small, age-reading error is correlated among readers, when both readers are biased, and for ages that are poorly represented in the sample. The method is applied for illustrative purposes to data on multiple-aged fish in Australia's southern and eastern scalefish and shark fishery.

	abstract = {Age information derived from calcified structures is commonly used to estimate recruitment, growth, and mortality for fish populations. Validation of daily or annual marks on age structures is often assumed, presumably due to a lack of general knowledge concerning the status of age validation studies. Therefore, the current status of freshwater fish age validation studies was summarized to show where additional effort is needed, and increase the accessibility of validation studies to researchers. In total, 1351 original peer-reviewed articles were reviewed from freshwater systems that studied age in fish. Periodicity and age validation studies were found for 88 freshwater species comprising 21 fish families. The number of age validation studies has increased over the last 30 years following previous calls for more research; however, few species have validated structures spanning all life stages. In addition, few fishes of conservation concern have validated ageing structures. A prioritization framework, using a combination of eight characteristics, is offered to direct future age validation studies and close the validation information gap. Additional study, using the offered prioritization framework, and increased availability of published studies that incorporate uncertainty when presenting research results dealing with age information are needed.},

	abstract = {Systematic underestimation of fish age can impede understanding of recruitment variability and adaptive strategies (like longevity) and can bias estimates of survivorship. We suspected that previous estimates of annual survival (S; range ¼ 0.20–0.44) for Lake Superior ciscoes Coregonus artedi developed from scale ages were biased low. To test this hypothesis, we estimated the total instantaneous mortality rate of adult ciscoes from the Thunder Bay, Ontario, stock by use of cohort-based catch curves developed from commercial gill-net catches and otolith-aged fish. Mean S based on otolith ages was greater for adult females (0.80) than for adult males (0.75), but these differences were not significant. Applying the results of a study of agreement between scale and otolith ages, we modeled a scale age for each otolith-aged fish to reconstruct catch curves. Using modeled scale ages, estimates of S (0.42 for females, 0.36 for males) were comparable with those reported in past studies. We conducted a November 2005 acoustic and midwater trawl survey to estimate the abundance of ciscoes when the fish were being harvested for roe. Estimated exploitation rates were 0.085 for females and 0.025 for males, and the instantaneous rates of fishing mortality were 0.089 for females and 0.025 for males. The instantaneous rates of natural mortality were 0.131 and 0.265 for females and males, respectively. Using otolith ages, we found that strong year-classes at large during November 2005 were caught in high numbers as age-1 fish in previous annual bottom trawl surveys, whereas weak or absent year-classes were not. For decades, large-scale fisheries on the Great Lakes were allowed to operate because ciscoes were assumed to be short lived and to have regular recruitment. We postulate that the collapse of these fisheries was linked in part to a misunderstanding of cisco biology driven by scale-ageing error.},

Ages from all structures were similar for sexually immature lake trout. For mature lake trout, estimated ages from otoliths and from opercular bones were the most precise, although ages from opercular bones were significantly younger by a year than ages from otoliths. Estimated ages from cleithra and whole vertebrae were, respectively, too imprecise and too low for these structures to be useful in age validation studies. On this basis, otoliths and opercular bones can be used in age validation studies and scales can be used to estimate the age of immature lake trout.},

	abstract = {Management agencies often estimate the ages of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides based on the examination of scales—a structure that is known to produce biased estimates—without knowing how the associated bias affects management decisions. We sought to understand the effects of this bias by comparing population metrics that were predicted using scale-derived and otolith-derived age data. We collected scales and otoliths from Largemouth Bass that were sampled during standard electrofishing surveys. The age of each fish was estimated independently by three separate readers using both scales and otoliths. We assessed the average coefficient of variation for scale-derived and otolithderived age estimates, examined the bias of scale-derived age estimates, and estimated von Bertalanffy growth model parameters by using ages estimated from scales and otoliths. These parameter estimates were used in yield-per-recruit simulations that predicted yield and the percentage of individuals in the cohort surviving to 380 mm (proportional size distribution [PSD] 380) or to 470 mm (PSD 470) at several levels of natural mortality and fishing mortality. Otolith-derived age estimates were more precise; scale-derived age estimates showed significant positive bias for fish younger than age 6 and significant negative bias for fish older than age 6. Von Bertalanffy parameter estimates were significantly different when using ages estimated from scales and those estimated from otoliths. Modeling indicated that estimates of yield and PSD 380 resulting from the two structures were similar. However, the use of scale-derived ages resulted in underestimating the impact of fishing mortality on PSD 470 by as much as five times at low levels of natural mortality and fishing mortality. Our estimates of precision and bias were similar to other comparisons of scales and otoliths, and the results of our yield-per-recruit simulations are likely generally applicable for Largemouth Bass management. Trophy fishing is a common management objective, and managers relying on scale-based age data could be less likely to adopt the restrictive harvest regulations that are critical for producing trophy Largemouth Bass.},
