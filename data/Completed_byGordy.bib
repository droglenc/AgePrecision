Reader agreement and coefficient of variation (CV) significantly differed across structures for both species. Otoliths had the highest complete and partial (i.e., at least two of three agree) reader agreement rates, while scales had the lowest for both species along with dorsal spines for Smallmouth Bass. Mean CV for otolith age estimates was 2.0\% for Largemouth Bass and 2.3\% for Smallmouth Bass; CV means for the nonlethal structures ranged from 8.0\% to 15.2\% for Largemouth Bass and from 10.0\% to 10.7\% for Smallmouth Bass. Age estimates derived from anal spines and dorsal spines underestimated ages of both species relative to otoliths. Otolith and scale age estimates were similar through age 9 for Largemouth Bass and through age 7 for Smallmouth Bass. Scale ages generally coincided with otolith ages for Largemouth Bass {\textless} 35 cm TL and for Smallmouth Bass {\textless} 31 cm TL. Neither anal spines nor dorsal spines proved to be a good nonlethal alternative for estimating ages, while scales may have utility for younger cohorts of both species. We recommend that otoliths be the standard structure for estimating Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass ages when sacrificing fish is acceptable. If sacrificing fish is a concern, then scales may be used as a surrogate for estimating ages of Largemouth Bass {\textless} 35 cm TL and Smallmouth Bass {\textless} 34 cm TL.},

Despite its ecological importance, relatively little is known regarding basic biology or life-history parameters for this species. Information on age and growth is particularly lacking for Pacific Sand Lance in the Salish Sea, an inland sea that encompasses the San Juan Archipelago in Washington State. Here, we present information on age and growth of Pacific Sand Lance from this region and then contrast it with a previous study based in Cook Inlet, Alaska. These 2 regions comprise the latitudinal extremes of the Gulf of Alaska large marine ecosystem. We found evidence for possible differences in growth of Pacific Sand Lance between the 2 regions, with San Juan Island fish generally being smaller at age than fish in Cook Inlet. We interpret these results with respect to regional and temporal differences in environmental conditions and resource availability linked to duration and magnitude of seasonal production, which we hypothesize affects the period of winter dormancy employed by this species as a strategy to cope with resource limitation.},

Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the age and growth of white grunt under a multi-model approach (information theory). A total of 421 individuals were sampled monthly on the continental shelf of Yucatan from September 2015 to August 2016. Five growth models were evaluated through a multi-model approach. Periodicity of growth zones was annual according to the marginal index. Maximum estimated age was 17 years and 90\% of the specimens were under 8 years of age. Models that best explained the growth of white grunt were asymptotic without an evident inflexion point (Johnson and von Bertalanffy models). The first growth estimate of this species in the southern Gulf of Mexico is reported with this approach, contributing elements to improve evaluations in future studies.},

An additional 85 otolith pairs (24 male, six female and 55 unsexed) were extracted in the same region between 2007 and 2014 (475−1525 mm FL, 2–23 years) and were utilised solely for modelling growth. Otolith aging revealed rapid growth and early maturation (L50 = 399.2 mm FL, A50 = 1.50 years). Sex change occurred over a wide size (790−1125 mm FL) and age (3–8 years) range and was initiated at 1082.3 mm FL and 6.2 years and completed at 1127.4 mm FL and 7.06 years. Strong evidence was provided for partial protandry in P. quadrifilis via the presence of several extremely old male fish, including one individual of 22 years and noticeable differences in length-at-age were observed between older male and female fish. To investigate potential life-history variability, three approaches were taken to group individuals and assess for improvements in model fit using the von Bertalanffy Growth Function (VBGF). Subgroups were determined by sex in Approach 1 and by predicted life-history pathway (‘changers’ \& ‘non-changers’) in Approaches 2 (individuals on sex change pathways have increased growth following sex change) \& 3 (individuals on sex change pathways have increased growth throughout ontogeny). In all approaches, differences were observed in the L∞ and k values between fish presumed to change sex and those presumed not to change sex. When compared to the conventional model produced for the entire population, all approaches produced considerably better model fit (Approach 1 = ΔAkaike Information Criterion (ΔAIC) = 64.7, Approach 2 – ΔAIC = 56.1 and Approach 3 – ΔAIC = 136.3) and Approach 3 produced better fit than Approach 1. This suggests that utilising conventional modelling techniques may be inappropriate for the stock assessment and management of sequential hermaphrodites and indicates that a revision of age-growth modelling techniques is required for species with multiple developmental pathways in order to maintain intrapopulation diversity and preserve resilience.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimates of age composition are essential for fisheries management, but evaluation of protocols to estimate age data are rarely conducted. Herein, known-age Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. from six hatchery stocks were used to examine accuracy of multiple scale-aging protocols and to assess how errors in age assignment may affect age composition estimated from scale data. Accuracy reached 1.0 for one stock of Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, over 0.9 for three stocks of spring Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, and was no higher than 0.8 for two stocks of fall Chinook Salmon. For all hatchery stocks, accuracy increased and bias decreased when readers had auxiliary information about a fish's fork length and sex. Results suggest that a protocol that collects scales from above the lateral line, provides auxiliary information on fork length and sex, allows readers to exclude individuals for which age appears unclear, and uses an arbitrator to assign age when two initial readers disagree may produce the most accurate and unbiased age data from scales. This study highlights the importance of assessing patterns in age errors both qualitatively and quantitatively. A general pattern of overestimating age for younger age-classes and underestimating age for older age-classes was evident. This pattern in age errors could affect age composition estimates for adult Pacific salmon and other species with few (e.g., two to six) age-classes. In addition, individual variation in demographic rates may affect individual patterns identified on scales; thus, for stocks with more extensive individual demographic variability, like fall Chinook Salmon stocks, accuracy may be lower and bias higher, resulting in less accurate estimates of age composition.},

Following the sharp decline of large carnivorous reef fishes, parrotfishes (Labridae: Scarinae) were progressively targeted by commercial fisheries in Brazil, resulting in a global population decline of 50\% for S. trispinosus. Most of its remnant population is concentrated in the Abrolhos Bank, where the present study was conducted. We present novel information on age, growth and the reproductive cycle of S. trispinosus, based on 814 individuals obtained from commercial fisheries’ landings and scientific collections, between 2010 and 2013. Sex ratio was biased toward females (1:8), and spawning occurred year-round with discrete peaks in February-March and June-December. Increment analysis indicated annual deposition of growth rings in otoliths, which presented 1–22 rings. The asymptotic length at which growth is zero (L∞) was estimated from a Bayesian logistic regression at 85.28 cm, growth rate (K) at 0.14 year−1, and the theoretical age at zero size (t0) at 0.16. Subregional demographic structuring was detected, with predominance of slower-growing individuals in shallower inshore reefs and predominance of faster-growing and older individuals in deeper offshore sites. We demonstrate that S. trispinosus is highly vulnerable to over-exploitation due to its large size, long live and slow-growth, and review the management measures proposed since its Red List assessment in 2012.},

Knobbed Porgy ranged from 1 to 21 years, and the largest fish measured 507 mm TL. Body size relationships relating TL, FL, and total body weight (W) for Knobbed Porgy were TL = 1.07·FL + 22.93 (n = 3,173; r2 = 0.97), FL = 0.91·TL − 12.54 (n = 3,173; r2 = 0.97), W = (1.38 × 10−5)TL3.03 (n = 12,732; r2 = 0.92), and W = (7.99 × 10−5)FL2.79 (n = 3,199; r2 = 0.90). Mean length at age was significantly different between Knobbed Porgy collected in North Carolina through southeast Florida (northern region) and those collected in the Florida Keys (southern region).

Age-varying estimates of natural mortality were 0.36–0.79 year−1 (ages 2–21) for the northern region and 0.42–0.67 year−1 (ages 1–12) for fish from the Florida Keys. Hydrated oocytes were present during February–April in macroscopically staged ovaries (n = 148) for fish from the Florida Keys, and gonadosomatic index data indicated that the month of peak spawning in females was April.

Marginal increment and edge analyses of Giant Cichlid otoliths indicated that one annulus formed per 12-month period in Lakes Yaxhá and Petén Itza. Opaque zone formation was associated with the peak of the rainy season from May to September. Ages ranged from 0 to 8 years for Giant Cichlids in Lake Yaxhá and from 0 to 5 years in Lake Petén Itza. Within both lakes, males were larger than females, although the difference was slight in Lake Petén Itza. Lake Yaxhá Giant Cichlids had faster growth rates than those from Lake Petén Itza, and fish over 2 years old from Lake Yaxhá were larger at age than fish from Lake Petén Itza. This is counter-intuitive because Lake Petén Itza is heavily exploited, whereas Lake Yaxhá is unfished. However, long-term exploitation in Lake Petén Itza may have resulted in selection for fish with reduced growth rates. Alternatively, the mesotrophic state of Lake Yaxhá may explain the differences in growth, although areas of Lake Petén Itza are changing from oligotrophic to meso-eutrophic due to rapid cultural eutrophication. Total mortality (Z) estimates for Giant Cichlids were 0.81 for Lake Yaxhá, with most of the age structured on 2–4-year-old fish, and 1.05 for Lake Petén Itzá, where the age structure was dominated by 0–2-year-old fish; these results were consistent with expectations based on the low fishing pressure in Lake Yaxhá.},

In this study, we conducted bomb radiocarbon age validations of Warsaw Grouper and Snowy Grouper from the Gulf of Mexico. Radiocarbon age validation supported annual growth increment formation for all Warsaw Grouper size classes and medium-sized Snowy Grouper. Conversely, ages of larger, older Snowy Grouper were greatly underestimated due to difficulty in discriminating annuli. This bomb radiocarbon analysis validates a minimum 56-year longevity for both Warsaw Grouper and Snowy Grouper, increasing the currently published longevities of 41 and 54 years, respectively.},

            Recent application of Fourier transform near infra-red spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) to predict age in fish otoliths has gained attention among fisheries managers as a potential alternative to costly production ageing of managed species. We assessed the age prediction capability of FT-NIRS scans in whole otoliths from red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, collected from the US Gulf of Mexico and US Atlantic Ocean (South Atlantic). Otoliths were scanned with an FT-NIR spectrometer and resulting spectral signatures were regressed with traditionally estimated ages via partial least squares regression to produce calibration models, which were validated for predictive capability against test sets of otoliths. Calibration models successfully predicted age with R2 ranging 0.94–0.95, mean squared error ≤1.8 years, and bias \&lt;0.02 years. Percent agreement between FT-NIRS and traditional ages was lower than within-reader agreement for traditional estimates, but average percent error was similar and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were not significantly different (p ≥ 0.06) between traditional and FT-NIRS predicted ages for optimal calibration models. Ages \&gt;31 years were not well predicted, possibly due to light attenuation in the thickest otoliths. Our results suggest that FT-NIRS can improve efficiency in production ageing for fisheries management while maintaining data quality standards.},

Attempts to develop optimal management strategies for effective conservation of the endemic Labeobarbus species are strongly affected by the lack of accurate age estimates. Although methodological studies are key to acquiring a good insight into the age of fishes, up to now, there have not been any studies comparing different methods for these species. Thus, this study aimed at determining the best method for the endemic Labeobarbus species. Samples were collected from May 2016 to April 2017. Asteriscus otoliths from 150 specimens each of L. intermedius, L. tsanensis, L. platydorsus, and L. megastoma were examined. Six methods were evaluated; however, only three methods resulted in readable images. The procedure in which whole otoliths were first submerged in water, and subsequently placed in glycerol to take the image (MO1), was generally best. Except for L. megastoma, this method produced the clearest image as both the coefficient of variation and average percentage error between readers were lowest. Furthermore, except for L. megastoma, MO1 had high otolith readability and no systematic bias. Therefore, we suggest that MO1 should be used as the standard otolith preparation technique for the first three species, while for L. megastoma, other preparation techniques should be evaluated. This study provides a reference for researchers from Africa, particularly Ethiopia, to develop a suitable otolith preparation method for the different tropical fish species.},

	abstract = {The common carp Cyprinus carpio is one of the most widely-distributed freshwater fishes in the world. Due to its value for conservation and fisheries in several native/translocated areas of distribution and its detrimental effects on the aquatic ecosystem in most invasive areas, robust age-based population dynamics models are required for successful management of this species. The present study provides a global review of age determination in carp, including a historical account of ageing methods, an assessment of the relative utility of ageing structures, and an evaluation of precision and accuracy (i.e. validation) of age estimates. Historically, scales were by far the most widely-employed structure, followed by the operculum, otolith, dorsal spine, vertebra and fin ray. However, in countries where carp is categorised as ‘high risk’ of impact, use of alternative structures to the scale was predominant. Causal criteria analysis showed scales and opercula to provide inconsistent evidence for successful annulus identification/counting, whereas consistent evidence was found for otoliths, dorsal spines, vertebrae and (pectoral) fin rays. Precision was always above reference thresholds for scales, whereas for otoliths, dorsal spines and fin rays was in several cases below. Accuracy was addressed sporadically and mostly in high-risk countries. It is suggested that dorsal spines or pectoral fin rays should be used in lieu of scales as non-lethal ageing structures, and otoliths (or vertebrae, pending more research) otherwise, and that validation should always be attempted as part of the set-up of more appropriate ageing protocols and use of correct terminology.},

The blue jack mackerel Trachurus picturatus (Bowdich, 1825) remains unassessed in a data-limited fishery in the eastern central Atlantic, within the waters of the Canary Islands (Spain) off the coast of northwest Africa. This is the most southwestern targeted fishery in the species’ distributional range. To obtain basic life-history information, a total of 2 472 specimens were analysed, ranging from 10.2 to 31.9 cm total length, from samples collected monthly between March 2005 and March 2006. Length–weight relationships (a = 0.0023; b = 3.418; R 2 = 0.97) showed no significant difference between sexes. Deposition periodicity and coherence of the ageing criteria were verified by analysis of the monthly evolution of the otolith edge. Ages were estimated by counting annual growth rings on whole otoliths, with these fish ranging from age 0 to 6 years. The von Bertalanffy growth model, which was used to estimate growth parameters from both direct readings and back-calculated length-at-age data, gave good statistical fits. The parameters from the direct readings were: L∞ = 34.9 cm; k = 0.214 y–1; t 0 = −2.545 y (R 2 = 0.84), and the natural mortality rates estimated from empirical methods varied between 0.20 and 0.55 y–1.},

	abstract = {Warsaw grouper, Hyporthodus nigritus, is a western Atlantic Ocean species typically found at depths between 55 and 525 m. It is listed as a species of concern by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service and as near threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. However, little information exists on the species’ life history in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) and its stock status in that region is currently unknown. Age of nGOM Warsaw grouper was investigated via opaque zone counts in otolith thin sections (max age = 61 y), and then the bomb 14C chronometer was employed to validate the accuracy of age estimates. Otolith cores (n = 14) were analyzed with accelerator mass spectrometry and resulting Δ14C values overlain on a loess regression computed for a regional coral and known-age red snapper Δ14C time series. Residual analysis between predicted Δ14C values from the loess regression versus Warsaw grouper otolith core Δ14C values indicated no significant difference in the two data series. Therefore, the accuracy of otolith-based aging was validated, which enabled growth and longevity estimates to be made for nGOM Warsaw grouper. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) Δ14C values collected from the nGOM support the inference that juvenile Warsaw grouper occur in shelf waters ({\textless}200 m) since DIC Δ14C values in this depth range are enriched in 14C and similar to the Δ14C values from otolith cores. A Bayesian model was fit to fishery-dependent age composition data and produced von Bertalanffy growth function parameters of L∞ = 1,533 mm, k = 0.14 y-1, and t0 = 1.82 y. Fishing mortality also was estimated in the model, which resulted in a ratio of fishing to natural mortality of 5.1:1. Overall, study results indicate Warsaw grouper is a long-lived species that is estimated to have experienced significant overfishing in the nGOM, with the age of most landed fish being {\textless}10 y.},

Objectives of this study were to estimate age and growth parameters of this species from two areas in the northern GOC and use an age-structured model to assess fishery yield and Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR) over a wide range of exploitations. Samples yielded fish up to age 8, although most were between age 2 and 5. Growth was extremely rapid, with most of the growth in length achieved in the first year, followed by much slower growth. Conditional rates of natural mortality averaged 0.37. Yield models predicted that spotted sand bass in the GOC were less vulnerable to fishing than those in the Pacific Ocean, likely due to faster growth and higher natural mortality. Growth overfishing and SPR values below 0.20 were only predicted at the lowest natural mortality and high ({\textgreater}0.50) exploitation rates. Results suggested that the species could support a commercial fishery in the GOC that might alleviate some of the conservation issues currently facing biologists in this unique marine ecosystem.},

The present study deals with some poorly known life history traits of this species, counting on 79 specimens collected in the Weddell Sea during 2014 and 2015 austral summer. Annulation pattern in sagittal otoliths were used to assess population age structure and growth rate, while macroscopic and histological analyses of gonads were performed to estimate reproductive status and features of gametogenesis. The sex ratio of the sampled population was close to parity, with females significantly larger than males. Based on the von Bertalanffy growth model, females attained a larger maximum size (40 vs. 27 cm) at a lower rate (0.05 vs. 0.12 years−1) than males. Individual longevity was remarkable in both sexes, females and males attaining 62 and 32 years of age, respectively. Females showed group synchronous oocyte development and presumed high reproductive effort, as indicated by the large size of residual hydrated oocytes in regressing individuals (4.6–4.8 mm). Body sizes at sexual maturity were 33 and 19 cm in females and males, corresponding to 32 and 11 years of age, respectively. All specimens were caught far from the reproductive season. From an evolutionary perspective, it appears that the process of pelagization similarly influenced the life strategies of the species within the clade Pleuragramminae, which shared high reproductive effort linked to early sexual maturity, slow somatic growth and long life span.},

	abstract = {The southern mullet Chelon richardsonii (Mugilidae) is the main target species of the inshore net fishery (gillnet and beach-seine) on the west coast of South Africa. The stock has displayed symptoms of overfishing, with a 28\% reduction in the standardised catch per unit effort (CPUE) between 2008 and 2016, and a 36.5-mm reduction in mean total length (TL) of fish in the commercial catch between 1998 and 2017. The socioeconomic importance of the inshore net fishery and concern regarding stock status necessitated an assessment of the C. richardsonii stock. This work presents an update of the life-history parameters and the first stock assessment of C. richardsonii at the centre of its distribution—Saldanha Bay and Langebaan Lagoon—using CPUE standardisation and per-recruit analysis. The sexes exhibited distinctive growth, with females growing larger, and their length-at-first-maturity was estimated at 205 mm TL, corresponding to age 2 years. Estimated natural mortality was 0.718 y–1, total mortality was 1.599 y–1, and fishing mortality was 0.881 y–1. Current spawner- biomass-per-recruit was estimated at 24.5\% of the pristine (unfished) levels, indicating a stock at risk of recruitment failure. An increase in the minimum stretched mesh size of the gillnets to 51 mm and a reduction in fishing mortality to 0.60 y–1 (approximately 30\%) would facilitate the recovery of the spawner biomass to the target of 40\% of pristine (SB40).},

The estimated ages (counts of presumed annual growth zones in the otoliths) were then evaluated with bomb-produced radiocarbon (14C) and Bayesian modelling with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. This study successfully demonstrated the level of accuracy in estimated ages of redstripe rockfish (a 35\% probability of underageing, and {\textasciitilde}5\% probability of overageing) and harlequin rockfish (a 100\% probability that they were underaged by {\textasciitilde}3 or 4 years). Measured Δ14C in shortspine thornyhead and shortraker rockfish otoliths was lower and increased later than expected. Hence, incorrect age determination could not be evaluated. This is likely caused by dissimilar environmental and biological availability of 14C between these two species and the Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) reference chronology, or underageing of these two species.},

	abstract = {The overexploitation of many traditionally targeted reef fishes, such as red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus (Poey, 1860), alongside the implementation of increasingly restrictive management measures on those species, has led to increased targeting of conventionally discarded Gulf of Mexico gray triggerfish, Balistes capriscus Gmelin, 1789, commercially and recreationally. The goal of this study was to assess age and growth of gray triggerfish from the Alabama Artificial Reef Zone in the north-central Gulf of Mexico. Gray triggerfish (n = 1135) were collected predominantly from artificial habitat during 1999–2017. Specimens were sexed macroscopically and ages were assigned by counting translucent increments in sections of the first dorsal spine. Fish ranged in size from 22 to 617 mm fork length. The oldest female was assigned an age of 9 yrs; the oldest male, 10 yrs. A suite of growth models was tested to develop combined and sex-specific models. The von Bertalanffy growth function best fit the combined data with parameters L∞ = 488.63 (SE 5.19), k = 0.57 (SE 0.02), and t0 = −0.27 (SE 0.03). Mean size-at-age differed between sexes for six of the eight ages which possessed sample sizes large enough to make comparisons. Growth differed between sexes, and the best-fitting version of the von Bertalanffy growth function permitted L∞ to vary by sex [female L∞ = 480.26 (SE 7.99); male L∞ = 532.89 (SE 8.95); k = 0.44 (SE 0.04); t0 = −0.78 (SE 0.16)]. These findings enhance our knowledge of the age and growth of Gulf of Mexico gray triggerfish.},

	abstract = {To fit a growth model to Opisthonema libertate, the most common thread herring in a small pelagic fishery in the southern Gulf of California, size data of commercial landings and age were generated from sagittal otoliths assessed during three different years, 2005, 2008 and 2015, representing Neutral, La Niña and El Niño environmental conditions, respectively. A multimodel select approach on five special submodels of generalized Schnute model, including one, equivalent to the Von Bertalanffy model, were used. A total of 573 otoliths were analyzed; 219 from Neutral, 149 from El Niño and 205 from The Niña events. An opaque zone of otoliths formed in winter-spring when chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations were at a maximum. However, a hyaline zone of otoliths formed during the summer of the reproductive period. Schnute submodel 1 was the best model selected in all three environmental conditions, but submodel 3 was the best on pooled data. Length of thread herring aged 0.5 years old in the El Niño year was lower than other environmental-years analyzed. A possible compensatory effect on growth with age was observed in the data because environmental conditions affected the growth of 0.5-year-old thread herring, as was evident in size variance in this age group under all three conditions, but variance decreased in the older age groups. Thus, a multimodel average of Schnute submodels 1 and 3 could be used to describe the growth of O. libertate in the southern Gulf of California.Keywords: Opisthonema liberate; growth; compensatory effect; multi-model selection; Gulf of California},

Age, growth, and maturity were examined for Finetooth Sharks, Carcharhinus isodon, in coastal waters of the Western North Atlantic Ocean (WNA) from Winyah Bay, South Carolina to Cape Canaveral, Florida. Ages were estimated from the vertebrae of 200 males and 232 females. The maximum observed age for males and females was 21.9 years and 22.3 years, respectively. Sizes ranged from 376 mm to 1174 mm fork length (FL) for males and 380 mm to 1282 mm FL for females. Significant differences were detected between the sexes necessitating sex-specific von Bertalanffy growth models yielding the following parameters: male, L∞ = 1140 mm FL, k = 0.29, L0 = 460 mm FL; female, L∞ = 1253 mm FL, k = 0.20, L0 = 464 mm FL. Median length (L50) at maturity was 1010 mm FL for males and 1043 mm FL for females corresponding to an age at median maturity (A50) of 6.6 years and 6.8 years, respectively. Significant differences in growth and maturity were detected between the current study and previously published parameters for the WNA and Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Observed differences in the WNA were driven by ageing methods, with current methods yielding significant differences in age estimates between studies. Results from the current study, in conjunction with previously published reproductive, tag-recapture and genetic studies, provide support for separate stocks between the WNA and GOM.},

	abstract = {Coastal sharks with small body sizes may be among the most productive species of chondrichthyans. The Australian sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon taylori) is one of the most productive members of this group based on work in northern and eastern Australia. However, life history information throughout the remainder of its range is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, the age, growth and maturity of R. taylori caught in the Gulf of Papua prawn trawl fishery in Papua New Guinea, were studied. One hundred and eighty six individuals, comprising 131 females (31–66 cm TL) and 55 males (31–53 cm TL) were aged using vertebral analysis and growth was modelled using a multi-model approach. The lack of small individuals close to the size at birth made fitting of growth curves more difficult, two methods (fixed length at birth and additional zero aged individuals) accounting for this were trialled. The von Bertalanffy growth model provided the best fit to the data when used with a fixed length-at-birth (L0 = 26 cm TL). Males (L∞ = 46 cm TL, k = 3.69 yr-1, L50 = 41.7 cm TL and A50 = 0.5 years) grew at a faster rate and matured at smaller sizes and younger ages than females (L∞ = 58 cm TL, k = 1.98 yr-1, L5o = 47.0 cm TL and A50 = 0.93 years). However, none of the methods to account for the lack of small individuals fully accounted for this phenomenon, and hence the results remain uncertain. Despite this, the results reaffirm the rapid growth of this species and suggest that the Gulf of Papua population may grow at a faster rate than Australian populations. Rhizoprionodon taylori is possibly well placed to withstand current fishing pressure despite being a common bycatch species in the Gulf of Papua prawn trawl fishery. However, further research needs to be undertaken to estimate other key life history parameters to fully assess the population status of this exploited shark species and its vulnerability to fishing in the Gulf of Papua.},

However, there is no biological information about its age and growth parameters, limiting the application of some quantitative population assessment methods, such as demographic models. The aim of the present study was to estimate, for the first time, age and individual growth of Z. exasperata. Biometric data from 244 individuals and 236 vertebrae were analysed. The largest number of banded guitarfish in fishery landings was observed during April and August, with a female:male sex ratio of 1:1.8. The size range was 56.4–103-cm total length (TL) for females and 51.6–92cm TL for males, with females being significantly larger than males (P{\textless}0.05). The periodicity of the vertebral edge suggests that growth band pairs form annually. The estimated age structure was 5–22.6 years for females and 4–19.6 years for males, with significant differences between sexes (P{\textless}0.01). The goodness-of-fit of three models was evaluated. For the von Bertalanffy growth model, the parameters were as follows. For females: theoretical maximum length, L∞ = 100.71cm TL; growth coefficient, k = 0.144year–1; and theoretical age at length zero, t0 = –0.39years. For males: L∞ = 89.78cm TL; k = 0.174year–1; and t0 = –0.65years.},

All samples were collected from specimens captured by pelagic longliners between March 2013 and September 2016, with sizes ranging from 82 to 301 cm fork length (LF). Two growth models were fitted to the age data, a three-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) re-parameterized to calculate L0 (size at birth) and a two-parameter VBGF with a fixed L0. The latter was considered the most adequate to describe the growth of the species, with the estimated parameters being L∞ = 283.8 cm LF, k  = 0.13 year−1 for males and L∞ = 290.6 cm LF, k = 0.12 year−1 for females. These results suggest that females have a slower growth than males. The maximum age estimated was 25 years, representing the oldest attributed age to this species so far. Further work is needed regarding P. glauca in the Indian Ocean, but this study adds important life-history information that can contribute for the management and conservation of the species.},

For male and female red lionfish, relationships between weight and total length (TL) were different by ecological region. Males achieved a greater mean weight adjusted for TL (333.6 g [standard error (SE) 3.6]) than females (195.1 g [SE 3.7]). A subsample of 1607 pairs of sagittal otoliths (from 744 males, 716 females, and 147 fish of unknown or undetermined sex) was used to assign ages. Ages ranged from 0.0 to 4.5 years (mean: 1.4 years), and these estimated ages and the dates of capture for specimens confirm the presence of red lionfish in the northern GOM in 2008, 2 years prior to the first detection of this species there. There were differences in age and growth between sexes within and among ecological regions, with males achieving higher growth rates and larger asymptotic lengths than females (all comparisons: P{\textless}0.01).

The von Bertalanffy growth parameters fitted to the average measured total lengths-at-age for each sex separately and estimated as L∞= 93.98 cm, k= 0.114 year-1, t0= -0.597 year for females, as L∞= 77.65 cm , k= 0.153 year-1, t0= -0.343 year for males and as L∞= 84.44 cm, k= 0.135 year-1, t0= -0.469 year for combined sexes. The growth performance value (Φ) of the European hake population was computed as 2.98 for combined sexes. Mean condition factor value for population was 0.654±0.021; the highest condition factor was found as 1.01 in fish at age 7.},

	abstract = {Small-bodied coastal sharks are often caught as by-catch in fishing operations. Life-history information for these sharks is needed to ascertain the level at which these populations are potentially affected by fishing. This study determined the age, growth and maturity of Carcharhinus coatesi captured by prawn trawlers in the Gulf of Papua. Using vertebral aging and an information-theoretic multimodel approach, the von Bertalanffy growth model fit the data best; parameters were L0 = 40.6 cm ± 0.8, L∞ = 74.8 cm ± 2.1, k = 0.33 year−1 ± 0.06. Length-at-maturity analysis indicated that males reach maturity at L50 = 66.3 cm (CI: 63.8, 71.4) and L95 = 71.6 (CI: 64.6, 74.2) cm while females matured at L50 = 71.4 cm (CI: 61.5, 72.01) and L95 = 72.5 cm (CI: 62.7, 74.0). Age-at-maturity estimates showed that both males (A50 = 5.1 years (CI: 4.6, 7.1), A95 = 6.4 years (CI: 5.1, 7.2)) and females (A50 = 5.3 years (CI: 3.5, 8.7), A95 = 7.4 years (CI: 3.6, 8.8)) reach maturity at about the same age. This study addresses the need for specific life-history information for a data-deficient species in a region that has remained relatively under-researched but in need of ongoing improvements to fisheries management.},

Reduced life-history diversity within these populations inhibits their ability to respond to these stressors. Putah Creek, a small creek in California’s Central Valley that once supported Chinook Salmon, is undergoing restoration to provide spawning habitats for this imperiled species. Beginning in 2014, increasing numbers of Chinook Salmon spawned throughout the creek and emigrating juveniles were observed in the following months. Here we used otolith annual growth bands and microchemistry to investigate the age structure and natal origins of the adult spawners. Most individuals were 2 or 3 years old and originated from at least seven different natal sources, overwhelmingly from Central Valley hatcheries ( 88\%). These findings highlight that straying fall-run Central Valley Chinook Salmon can rapidly utilize restored habitats, potentially establishing new populations. However, to facilitate local adaptations, straying rates and gene flow will have to be managed over time. Reconnecting migratory pathways and restoring many small and diverse streams like Putah Creek thus provides an opportunity to increase life-history diversity, strengthening the recovery and resilience of Chinook Salmon.},

	abstract = {Background. Peipsi whitefish, Coregonus maraenoides Polyakov, 1874, is an endemic species of Lake Peipsi (Chudskoe) in Estonia and Russia. In the mid-1970s, it was introduced into the biggest Bulgarian artificial body of water-the Iskar Reservoir (Danube River basin). A recent survey confirmed the existence of a self-sustaining population of the Peipsi whitefish in the dam lake. Establishing a suitable method for determining Peipsi whitefish age would allow fishery managers and biologists to extract valuable information on various population parameters. Therefore, the aim of the presently reported study was to test the suitability of scales, pectoral fin rays, and otoliths for the most reliable age determining of Peipsi whitefish. Material and methods. Age estimates were obtained from transverse sections of sagittal otoliths and pectoral fins, and scales from 54 Peipsi whitefish, collected between October and March 2016-2017. Two readers estimated ages from all three structures independently. The precision and bias of age estimates between readers and among structures were compared using age bias plots, coefficient of variation (CV), percent agreement (PA), and level of readability. Mean consensus ages from two readers for each structure were compared. Results. Mean consensus age estimates obtained by analysing the scales (2.0 years) were significantly lower than those obtained by analysing the fin rays (2.6) and otoliths (2.7). Between-reader percent agreement was lower and the coefficient of variation was higher for otoliths (PA = 22.2\%; CV = 27.6) compared with scales (PA = 46.6\%; CV = 10.02) and pectoral fin rays (PA = 67.4\%; CV = 10.12). Comparison of age estimates from the different structures revealed the highest PA and the lowest CV values between otoliths and pectoral fin rays (PA = 62.6\%; CV = 10.03\%), while the lowest PA and highest CV (PA = 35\%, CV = 25.03) were observed between age estimates from fin rays and scales (CV, P {\textgreater} 0. 005). The otolith and scale ages agreed for 46.7\% and CV was 21.5. The scales were considered by both readers with the highest level of readability (88.9\%) than the pectoral fin rays (70.4\%) and otoliths (50\%). Conclusion. The use of fin rays is recommended for the age estimation of C. maraenoides from the Iskar Reservoir but further work is needed to validate the accuracy of ageing methodology for small, under one-year old Peipsi whitefish.},

Our objectives were to (1) estimate age of juvenile Atlantic Sturgeon by using pectoral spine sections; (2) determine annual growth periodicity in hatchery-reared and recaptured wild Atlantic Sturgeon to validate our aging method; (3) determine growth rates for recaptured juveniles; and (4) back-calculate lengths from ages estimated by using pectoral spine sections from captured juveniles. Fish were captured via gillnetting in Newburgh and Haverstraw bays, Hudson River, during fall 2003, spring and fall 2004, and spring and fall 2005. Two readers agreed upon 91\% (n = 474) of ages estimated for juvenile Atlantic Sturgeon, establishing a coefficient of variation of 1.7\%. Eight year-classes (ages 1–8) were represented, with age-4 fish making up the largest age-class (39\%; n = 203) and age-1 fish being the least represented ({\textless}1\%; n = 4). Multi-annual oxytetracycline injections in four cohorts of hatchery-reared Atlantic Sturgeon (n = 34) demonstrated a two-part zone for each year of growth, as did four recaptured juveniles that were at liberty for a least 1 year, which exhibited mean growth rates of 0.3 mm/d and 2.4 g/d. We back-calculated median FLs from annulus positioning in ages 2–8 by using dorsal and ventral lobes of pectoral spine sections and compared the results to actual reported lengths. Dorsal and ventral lobes underestimated the median FLs of all age-classes except ages 3 and 7, for which lengths were overestimated. We found statistical differences between dorsal- and ventral-derived median FLs, suggesting that both regions must be evaluated. Our overall goal is to provide researchers with a baseline of age and growth data for future work on juvenile Atlantic Sturgeon.},

The presence of OTC time stamps in these calcified structures and the ability to correctly identify post–time stamp annuli varied greatly. We identified time stamps in 66.7\% and 91.7\% of the otoliths and 43.8\% and 61.4\% of the pectoral fin rays for Longnose Gars and Spotted Gars, respectively; OTC marks were not observed in branchiostegal rays. Annual increment periodicity was validated in ground sagittal otoliths through age 10 for both species. For fish older than age 10, accuracy declined to about 60\%, with most estimates being less than the number of post–time stamp annuli by 1 year. Age estimates derived from pectoral fin rays were consistently less than the number of post–time stamp annuli because OTC marks were generally associated with the outer edge of this bone. Overall accuracy from pectoral fin rays was only 14.3\% for Longnose Gars and 22.6\% for Spotted Gars. Although the lack of time stamps in branchiostegal rays prevented formal evaluation, age estimates derived from this structure were substantially lower than those from otoliths. Precision among readers was poor for all structures, reflecting the difficulties associated with age estimation for these two species. Based on our evaluation, past age estimates from branchiostegal rays and pectoral fin rays should be considered suspect. Ages derived from sagittal otoliths can be reliable through age 10. However, we recommend that readers verify their ability to produce accurate estimates and consider the implications of underestimating age for fish greater than age 10. Future efforts should work to refine or develop alternative preparation procedures for otoliths to improve the visibility of annuli and validate age estimates for older age-classes.},

	abstract = {Population-level studies often require age estimation of fish, but populations in small rivers and streams are generally smaller than those in large rivers or reservoirs. Therefore, non-lethal aging methods are generally recommended to minimize the potentially negative effects of sampling on population size. Accordingly, our main goal was to compare otoliths and scales as structures for estimating the age of redbreast sunfish (Lepomis auritus) and green sunfish (L. cyanellus) in an urban watershed. Reader agreement was greater for otoliths (88\%–89\%) than for scales (73\%–79\%), and precision (mean CV) in age estimates was better for otoliths (3.7\%–4.0\%) than scales (6.1\%–9.4\%) for both species. Readers were significantly more confident in their otolith-derived age estimates than scale-derived age estimates for both species. For redbreast sunfish and green sunfish, age estimation bias between readers was apparent for scales, but not for otoliths. Otolith-estimated ages of redbreast sunfish ranged from 0 to 7 years, while scale-estimated ages ranged from 1 to 6 years. For green sunfish, otolith-estimated ages ranged from 1 to 7 years, while scale-estimated ages ranged from 0 to 5 years. Mean estimated ages were significantly different between otolith-based and scale-based ages for both species. Scales generally overestimated otolithassigned ages of younger redbreast sunfish and underestimated otolith-assigned ages of older fish. For green sunfish, scales generally underestimated otolith-assigned ages of older fish. Annual survival estimates derived from catch-curve analyses also differed between otoliths and scales for both species. We recommend that biologists avoid using scales to estimate the ages of redbreast sunfish and green sunfish. When a non-lethal aging method is required, biologists should use extreme caution in using scales, and explore other non-lethal methods for age estimation.},

Anal fin spines and scales are used by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for age estimation, but these structures may provide lower precision and accuracy than otoliths. The primary objective of our assessment was to determine if age estimates, among-reader precision, and mean back-calculated total lengths (TLs) at age differed among scales, anal fin spines, and otoliths. Ages estimated from anal fin spines were more precise than scale ages, were as precise as otolith-based ages, and generally agreed with consensus ages estimated from sectioned otoliths. Relationships between TL and radii of calcified structures were linear for scales, anal spines, and otoliths along two different transects. Mean back-calculated TLs were generally similar between intercept-corrected direct proportion (ICDP) and linear regression (LR) models, but otolith-based direct proportion models (no intercept correction) generally provided higher back-calculated mean TLs at ages 1 and 2 than ICDP and LR models. Mean back-calculated TLs at age estimated from whole otoliths were higher than estimates for other structures; but differences among anal fin spines, scales, and sectioned otoliths were {\textless}10 mm. Our results suggest biologists have little to gain by switching to otoliths when assessing age structure and growth for this fast-growing yellow perch population with relatively few fish ≥age 6, but additional analyses are warranted for slower-growing perch populations in the Great Lakes where older fish are more common.},

All harvest is virtually unregulated and unstudied, and Bigmouth Buffalo are declining while little is known about their biology.

Recent efforts by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council to manage the Northwest Atlantic stock have necessitated the description of its life-history characteristics. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the utility of ageing methods, describe the length-at-age and weight-at-length relationships, and compare estimated growth parameter values to those reported from other regions. We found that whole otoliths provided the most precise method for age determination of Atlantic chub mackerel. Age estimates were derived for adult (n = 422) and larval fish (n = 60). Parameter estimates of individual growth models were determined using a Bayesian framework. The length-at-age relationship was described using four non-linear candidate growth models, which were fit to total length (TL, cm) and age estimates (y). We found that the three-parameter VBGF (L∞ = 33.56 cm TL, k = 1.75 y-1, t0 = 0.07 y) was the best candidate model to describe the length-atage relationship. A power function was used to describe the weight-at-length relationship from 1 136 individuals (a = 0.0258, b = 2.72). We found that individuals exhibit a greater rate of growth and reach smaller average maximum length when compared to published estimates in other regions. The rate of increase of weight relative to length was found to be significantly lower than that reported in other regions. These results can be used to inform assessment of the Atlantic chub mackerel stock in the Northwest Atlantic.},

Marginal increment values were estimated in order to identify a tendency toward annual band formation, with this pattern assumed for both species. There was no significant difference in growth between sexes and the estimated parameters were: L∞ = 78.10 cm; k = 0.301; t0 = -1.463 years for R. lalandii and L∞ = 112.99 cm; k = 0.171; t0 = -1.751 years for R. porosus. Age ranged from one to six years for R. lalandii, with an age at first maturity (tmat) of 2.6 years; the majority of the sample was formed by adult individuals (61.9\%). For R. porosus, age ranged from less than one year (0+) to five years, with tmat = 3.3 years; the majority of the sample was made up of juveniles (72.4\%). Contrary to what was found for R. lalandii, the estimated L∞ for R. porosus was much greater than the maximum length in this sample (85.5 cm). This is attributed to the selectivity of the gillnet, which is gear that catches R. lalandii individuals in all age classes and R. porosus individuals up to five years of age.},

	abstract = {Growth rates and longevities were estimated for five major fishery species of parrotfishes (“uhu”) at Oahu, Hawai'i. All species grew rapidly with von Bertalanffy Growth Formula (VBGF) k values ≥ 0.4 yr-1. Longevities were found to range broadly among the three SMALL species—4 yr in Calotomus carolinus and 6 and 11 yr in Scarus psittacus and Chlorurus spilurus—and to 15-20 yr in S. rubroviolaceus and Chlorurus perspicillatus for the two LARGE species. Age-reading and growth curves for the latter two LARGE species were validated using bomb radiocarbon dating. Median ages at sexual maturity as females (AM50) and at sex change (from female to terminal phase male, A∆50) were estimated using logistic models. Sexual maturation occurred at 1–2 yr for the SMALL species and at 3–3½ yr in the LARGE species. A∆50 estimates ranged from 2–4 yr in the SMALL species and were about 5 and 7 yr in S. rubroviolaceus and C. perspicillatus, respectively. Estimated milestones poorly corresponded to the current minimum legal size for uhu in Hawai'i (12" or 30.5 cm fork length). Pooling these parrotfishes for management seems generally inappropriate, especially for the two LARGE species. Age-based metrics are more informative than size-based metrics for these fishes},

Sagittae, and anal and dorsal fin spine sections contained growth zones assumed to be annual events and there was a linear relationship between age estimates of corresponding samples. Vertebrae had numerous minute growth increments, but contained no marks' which could be interpreted as annual. While nonparametric tests revealed no significant difference between age estimates from different hardparts of the same fish, dorsal and anal spine counts had the best agreement. Anal and dorsal fin spines were more practical in terms of ease of collection, processing, legibility, and interpretation; however, age estimates of spine samples from larger fish required a statistical replacement of inner growth zones that were destroyed by matrix expansion. Although more difficult to collect and interpret, sagittae provide more detailed age information. Mean length-at-estimated age data based on anal spine band counts are also presented.},

Ring formation frequency was determined to be annual by using marginal increment analysis. The von Bertalanffy growth function parameters were estimated as: L∞ = 43.7 cm LS; K =0.22 year; t0 = -1.59 years. Functional males are significantly younger than functional females, with sexually transitional individuals between the modal ages of males and females supporting protandry in this species. Males become sexually mature within 1 year and 50\% age at sex change is at 2 years. The maximum age recorded for both males and females sampled was 9 years which is lower than for conspecifics elsewhere and may reflect high fishing pressure in the study area when compared with conspecifics in other areas or could reflect latitudinal effects. Otolith mass was significantly and positively related to age, providing a cheap and quick alternative method for approximating age. Acanthopagrus schlegelii is a relatively fast-growing and rapidly maturing species attaining a similar asymptotic length to conspecifics. A need for fishery management is indicated to protect both young juveniles and older adults, especially females, to increase reproductive output and safeguard fishery production.},

	abstract = {Fish otoliths' chronometric properties make them useful for age and growth rate estimation in fisheries management. For the Eastern Baltic Sea cod stock (Gadus morhua), unclear seasonal growth zones in otoliths have resulted in unreliable age and growth information. Here, a new age estimation method based on seasonal patterns in trace elemental otolith incorporation was tested for the first time and compared with the traditional method of visually counting growth zones, using otoliths from the Baltic and North seas. Various trace elemental ratios, linked to fish metabolic activity (higher in summer) or external environment (migration to colder, deeper habitats with higher salinity in winter), were tested for age estimation based on assessing their seasonal variations in concentration. Mg:Ca and P:Ca, both proxies for growth and metabolic activity, showed greatest seasonality and therefore have the best potential to be used as chemical clocks. Otolith image readability was significantly lower in the Baltic than in the North Sea. The chemical (novel) method had an overall greater precision and percentage agreement among readers (11.2\%, 74.0\%) than the visual (traditional) method (23.1\%, 51.0\%). Visual readers generally selected more highly contrasting zones as annuli whereas the chemical readers identified brighter regions within the first two annuli and darker zones thereafter. Visual estimates produced significantly higher, more variable ages than did the chemical ones. Based on the analyses in our study, we suggest that otolith microchemistry is a promising alternative ageing method for fish populations difficult to age, such as the Eastern Baltic cod.},

Marginal increment analysis was used to validate annulus counts, with attention to the 'edge interpretation problem'. The formation of annuli occurred annually after pooling annulus groups, and in carp 4 and 5 years old. The regular alternation of opaque and translucent zones in opercular bones and whole otoliths of younger and older carp was also suggestive of annual periodicity. From systematic comparisons, the use of both opercular bones and whole otoliths in routine age determinations is recommended. Six growth models, including the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) and five polynomial curves were tested to describe growth in length. A log-log quadratic function, by virtue of its precision, and the VBGF, with wider applicability and more biological realism, were chosen.},
